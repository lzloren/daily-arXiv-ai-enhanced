A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge.

We provide a novel GUI that allows a user to provide text\ninput for an LLM to generate instructions which it can then self-complete.\nEmpirical results indicate that these instructions \\textit{can} improve a\nreinforcement learning agent's performance. Therefore, we present this work to\naccelerate the evaluation of language solutions on reward based environments to\nenable new opportunities for scientific discovery."}

In this context, for system-of-systems the\nuse of efficient dedicated approaches (often physics-based simulations) is\nhighly recommended to reduce the computational complexity of the targeted\napplications. However, exploring novel architectures using such dedicated\napproaches might pose challenges for optimization algorithms, including\nincreased evaluation costs and potential failures. To address these challenges,\nsurrogate-based optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization\nutilizing Gaussian process models have emerged."}
