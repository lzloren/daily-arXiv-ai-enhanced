This paper explores the\nintegration of two emerging paradigms enabled by large language models: Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) and Large Action Models (LAMs). We argue that LRMs\naddress the challenges of semantic reasoning and ecosystem complexity while\nLAMs excel in dynamic action execution and system interoperability. However,\neach paradigm has complementary limitations - LRMs lack grounded action\ncapabilities, and LAMs often struggle with deep reasoning. We propose an\nintegrated LRM-LAM architectural framework as a promising direction for\nadvancing automated service composition.

This overlooks challenges stemming from\nthe evolving nature of TKGs, such as: (i) the model's requirement to generalize\nand assimilate new knowledge, and (ii) the task of managing new or unseen\nentities that often have sparse connections. In this paper, we present an\nincremental training framework specifically designed for TKGs, aiming to\naddress entities that are either not observed during training or have sparse\nconnections. Our approach combines a model-agnostic enhancement layer with a\nweighted sampling strategy, that can be augmented to and improve any existing\nTKG completion method. The enhancement layer leverages a broader, global\ndefinition of entity similarity, which moves beyond mere local neighborhood\nproximity of GNN-based methods.

Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by\nnarrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the\ncode-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the\nsignificance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this\ncontext remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating\ncode-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from\nseven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating\nsynthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.\nOur analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets\ninvolving multiple language families.

However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks\ndue to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused\non enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural\ninnovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match\nthe performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that\nthis limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not\nwell-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a\nchunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth\nReading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual\ninformation, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more\ncompatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method\nsubstantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention\nLLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of\nRecurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from\n5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.\nBesides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and\ninferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using\nRecurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks.

First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of\nmedical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of\nmethodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and\nsemantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often\ninadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full\nspectrum of real world medical tasks.\n  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned\non diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across\nmultiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.\n  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks\nspanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled\non the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of\nmedical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only\nestablishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that\nconsistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMEDTE\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b51\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8303\u56f4\u7a84\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u9648\u65e7\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528MEDTE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u533b\u7597\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b51\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6587\u672c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408MEDTE\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
