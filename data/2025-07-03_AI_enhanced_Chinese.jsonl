Critics seized upon\nthe findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack\ngenuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.\nMeanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning\nthe experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify\nthis debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most\ncontentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing\nincremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that\npreviously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result\nof output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs\nstill stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the\nRiver Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to\nhinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to\nsolvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100\nagent pairs.

This article is a significantly extended version of a paper\n  presented by the authors at IJCAI-2022", "summary": "Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem\nsolving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u987b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eGelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u8ba8\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8d28\u7591\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u5426\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f8b\u5b50\u8bf4\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6539\u8fdbGelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u826f\u597d\u652f\u6301\u6027\u3001\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5426\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5426\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u826f\u597d\u652f\u6301\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b4\uff09\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b5\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b6\uff09\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u65f6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u539f\u5219\u80fd\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u987b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Gelfond\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u539f\u5219\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u5408\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
