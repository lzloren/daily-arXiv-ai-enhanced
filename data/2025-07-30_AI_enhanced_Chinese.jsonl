However, they often face challenges in\nacquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a\ncomplementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982AI Social Gym\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7ebf\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d7Vygotsky\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883'AI Social Gym'\uff0cAI\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u6559\u5b66\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u672c\u4f53\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u63d0\u95ee\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u5411\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u6d1e\u5bdf\u878d\u5165AI\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u8865\u5145\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations.

We systematically\nvary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday\ntopics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that\nGPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed\nquestion than to a neutral one. This suggests a \"rebound\" bias where the model\novercorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive\ntopics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:\ntone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We\nintroduce concepts like the \"tone floor\" - a lower bound in response negativity\n- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations\nbased on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone.

While existing evaluation\nmethods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general\napproach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology\ncontent degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these\neffects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce\nMNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight\nframework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing.

Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics.

Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single\namateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure\nmodes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic\ndrift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a\ngeneralization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models\nto more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD\nintegrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus\npenalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate\neffectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables\ncontrollable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or\ncontent biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,\nencyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses\nconventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,\ncoherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional\ntraining or fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4e1a\u4f59\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff08MACD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u4e1a\u4f59\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff08CD\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u4e1a\u4f59\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u91cd\u590d\u3001\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u3002", "method": "MACD\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u4e1a\u4f59\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u5171\u8bc6\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\u6574\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u591a\u4e1a\u4f59\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMACD\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u767e\u79d1\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u539f\u59cbCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MACD\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

Experiments\nacross both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO\ntrained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in\nmost cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in\ninstruction-based prompting.

In practical\nterms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and\nlinguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that\nhave been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way\nto objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a\ngiven text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the\nuse of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to\nknow which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary\ngenres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to\ndevise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute\nArabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.\nA comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their\ndefinitions was compiled.

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,\nthe universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty\nlevels.

This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a\nProblem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,\noptimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.\nAfterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,\ngreatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The\nproposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators\nto derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating\ntechnical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and\nend-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed architecture and methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u914d\u7535\u7f51\uff08ADN\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u67b6\u6784\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u80fd\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u5728ADN\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u4f7f\u5f97\u8c03\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f97\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u52a0\u5165\u7684ADN\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u4e13\u5bb6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06ADN\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u5668\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u7a0b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u6280\u672f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86ADN\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While prior work has\nlargely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often\nneglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,\nwe first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA\nPrinciples of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and\nthe CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nTrident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,\nfinancial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and\ndomain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals\nkey safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic\nexpectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle\nethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained\ndomain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work\nprovides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law\nand finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the\nsafety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields.

However, persistent concerns about\nembedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their\ntraining data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal\nconsequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which\nLLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.\nSpecifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in\ninternational survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three\ncomplementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by\nmodels versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment\nanalyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM\noutputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative\nprompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that\ncurrent LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral\nvariation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with\nempirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more\nrobust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in\nLLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible\ndevelopment and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical\nalignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u5dee\u5f02\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u5dee\u5f02\u4e14\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63d0\u793a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "LLM\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u590d\u73b0\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u5316\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Results\nreveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,\nthey struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text.

Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA\nmodels reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers\neffectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM\nreasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong\ntransferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing\nthinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor\nreasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "HumorBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5361\u901a\u5b57\u5e55\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7300\u4e2a\u5361\u901a-\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u5e7d\u9ed8\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0cSTEM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728STEM\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975eSTEM\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "HumorBench\u5305\u542b\u7ea6300\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5ba2\u300b\u548cCartoonstock.com\u7684\u5361\u901a-\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5143\u7d20\u3002LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u91ca\u5e7d\u9ed8\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b11\u8bdd\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\uff081\uff09LLMs\u7684STEM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8eSTEM\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728HumorBench\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u5bf9\u5e7d\u9ed8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "HumorBench\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that\nEvo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only\ndecoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.\nWe present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the\ncontributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router.

Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment.

In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data.

Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency.

The\nrapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,\nmachine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the\nforefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),\n\"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset\nEnvironments using Deep Learning\", which evaluated different deep learning\nmodels for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the\noriginal results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to\nstrengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the\nsetup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing\nresults to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the\nreplication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating\nreplication readiness.

These techniques use mathematical\nmethods to improve decision-making.\n  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend\nconsiderable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations\ncoming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer\nwhat-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools\nto reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires\ninvolving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results\nor make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows\ndown decision making.\n  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report\nhow this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -\nnamely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the\ninteraction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop.

Experimental\nresults on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner\nworkings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary\nmodels struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning\nis required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.\nFinally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving\nLLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff08KG\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6MAGIC\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u95ee\u7b54\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9e\u4f53\u66ff\u6362\u6280\u672f\u53ca\u51b2\u7a81\u7c7b\u578b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6846\u67b6MAGIC\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u5fae\u5999\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7KG\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709LLMs\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u77db\u76fe\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdbLLMs\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6837\uff08\u751a\u81f3\u51b2\u7a81\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

We highlight recent advances, practical case\nstudies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional\nmethods.

We fine-tune three LRMs on\nUnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six\nout-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain\nconsistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or\nsurpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of correction-based supervision.

The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a\ngiven Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration\nexploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.\nHowever, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the\nstate-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term\ndependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy\niterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to\nminimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function\ninitializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the\nadjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal\nprocessing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of\nnonlinear graph filters.

In this paper, we propose\n$\\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed\nsampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential\nequations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the\noptimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost\nperformance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using\nSDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while\napplying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the\ntime-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and\nallowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.\nAdditionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in\noptimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling.

This paper\npresents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,\ncombining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning\ncapabilities of RBNs.\n  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs\ndirectly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an\nexternal component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational\nproperties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also\npropose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic\nmodels.\n  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct\nproblems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective\nclassification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label\npatterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a\nmulti-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where\nMAP inference supports complex decision-making.

Consequently, 12 out of 22 valid teams outperformed the whisper-large-v2\nbaseline in terms of WER, while 17 teams surpassed the baseline on SemScore.\nNotably, the top team achieved the lowest WER of 8.11\\%, and the highest\nSemScore of 88.44\\% at the same time, setting new benchmarks for future ASR\nsystems in recognizing impaired speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "2025\u5e74Interspeech\u8bed\u97f3\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u9879\u76ee\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u5229\u7528400\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u8005\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c12\u652f\u56e2\u961f\u5728WER\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c17\u652f\u5728SemScore\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528500\u591a\u540d\u8bed\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u8005\u7684400\u591a\u5c0f\u65f6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7EvalAI\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eWER\u548cSemScore\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "12\u652f\u56e2\u961f\u5728WER\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8awhisper-large-v2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c17\u652f\u5728SemScore\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\uff1b\u6700\u4f73\u56e2\u961fWER\u4e3a8.11%\uff0cSemScore\u4e3a88.44%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u97f3\u969c\u788d\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}
