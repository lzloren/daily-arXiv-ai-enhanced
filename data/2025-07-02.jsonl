Instead of treating\nthe GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual\nelements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality\nindependently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions\nare ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by\ngenerating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions\nand incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This\nhierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts\nwithout the need for additional training or annotations.

These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent\ndocumentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for\naccurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table\nextraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor\nperformance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This\npaper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be\nextracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,\ncausing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a\nnovel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically\nenriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text\nlinearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve\nboth structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental\nevaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates\nTalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering\ntasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS\nTextract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that\nthe Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management\napplications.
