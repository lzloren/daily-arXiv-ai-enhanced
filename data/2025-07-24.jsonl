Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions.

We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas.

To address\nthis gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the\ncomputational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to\nsystematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural\nconfigurations and EL.

Therefore, we aim to propose a\nmore comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to\ndiagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a\nStructured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used\nstructured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a\nquestion, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To\nevaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we\nexpand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness,\nOrder Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical\nevaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1,\nindicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding\nstructured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as\nthe amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination\nphenomenon.

Yet, little is known about how closely\nLLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral\nDilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a\ndistribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a\nfree-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high\nconsensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In\nparallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions\nextracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral\nvalues than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch\nin both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,\nwe introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method\nthat conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves\nalignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more\npluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs."}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an\ninference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort\nfor parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model\narchitecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different\nbenefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity\ncalculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To\naddress this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by\ncombining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding\nRAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects\nretrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;\nhowever, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG\ngenerates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then\nselects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average\nimprovements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,\nrespectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models\nindicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various\ndomains. We will release our code upon publication."}

Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed\nby translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks\ntowards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this\nwork, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a\nbenchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and\nculturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French,\nSpanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:\nlanguage-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition\nreasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition\nreasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English\nequivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation\nfrom native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can\nprovide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.\nEnglish on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14\nleading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent\nset. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native\nmultilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs\nexhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and\nlogical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math\nreasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating\npersistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge."}

Unlike earlier efforts that used\ninteractive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI\nenables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust\nto interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.\n  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on\nlarge language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech\nsynthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative\nresearch, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order\nrandomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.\n  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot\nsurveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate\nhuman-administered survey to assess respondent experiences.
