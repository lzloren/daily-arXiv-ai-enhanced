### [1] [The Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20702)
*Yoshua Bengio,Tegan Maharaj,Luke Ong,Stuart Russell,Dawn Song,Max Tegmark,Lan Xue,Ya-Qin Zhang,Stephen Casper,Wan Sie Lee,Sören Mindermann,Vanessa Wilfred,Vidhisha Balachandran,Fazl Barez,Michael Belinsky,Imane Bello,Malo Bourgon,Mark Brakel,Siméon Campos,Duncan Cass-Beggs,Jiahao Chen,Rumman Chowdhury,Kuan Chua Seah,Jeff Clune,Juntao Dai,Agnes Delaborde,Nouha Dziri,Francisco Eiras,Joshua Engels,Jinyu Fan,Adam Gleave,Noah Goodman,Fynn Heide,Dan Hendrycks,Cyrus Hodes,Bryan Low Kian Hsiang,Minlie Huang,Sami Jawhar,Wang Jingyu,Adam Tauman Kalai,Meindert Kamphuis,Mohan Kankanhalli,Subhash Kantamneni,Mathias Bonde Kirk,Thomas Kwa,Jeffrey Ladish,Kwok-Yan Lam,Wan Lee Sie,Taewhi Lee,Xiaojian Li,Jiajun Liu,Chaochao Lu,Yifan Mai,Richard Mallah,Julian Michael,Nick Moës,Simon Möller,Kihyuk Nam,Kwan Yee Ng,Mark Nitzberg,Besmira Nushi,Seán O hÉigeartaigh,Alejandro Ortega,Pierre Peigné,James Petrie,Benjamin Prud'Homme,Reihaneh Rabbany,Nayat Sanchez-Pi,Sarah Schwettmann,Buck Shlegeris,Saad Siddiqui,Aradhana Sinha,Martín Soto,Cheston Tan,Dong Ting,Robert Trager,Brian Tse,Anthony Tung K.

TL;DR: 新加坡2025年AI会议报告聚焦AI安全性研究，提出开发、评估和控制的三大领域挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力和自主性的快速提升，确保其安全、可信赖和可靠成为关键，需建立信任生态系统。

Method: 采用纵深防御模型，将AI安全性研究分为开发（可信AI系统）、评估（风险）和控制（部署后监控与干预）三大领域。

Result: 报告基于国际AI安全报告，汇集全球AI科学家意见，明确了AI安全研究的优先方向。

Conclusion: 构建可信的AI生态系统是推动创新并避免反弹的关键，需多领域合作解决开发、评估和控制挑战。

Abstract: Rapidly improving AI capabilities and autonomy hold significant promise of
transformation, but are also driving vigorous debate on how to ensure that AI
is safe, i.e., trustworthy, reliable, and secure. Building a trusted ecosystem
is therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives
maximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.
  The "2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific
Exchange on AI Safety" aimed to support research in this space by bringing
together AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research
priorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI
Safety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By
adopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research
domains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems
(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and
challenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control).

### [2] [MAGPIE: A dataset for Multi-AGent contextual PrIvacy Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20737)
*Gurusha Juneja,Alon Albalak,Wenyue Hua,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于LLM的代理在协作任务中是否理解上下文隐私，并评估了现有模型在保护隐私方面的表现。结果显示当前模型在隐私保护方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于LLM的代理在多任务协作中的广泛应用，隐私保护成为关键问题。现有评估基准主要针对单轮简单任务，缺乏对复杂场景下隐私保护能力的评估。

Method: 提出了一个名为MAGPIE的基准测试，包含158个高风险场景，评估LLM代理对上下文隐私的理解及协作中的隐私保护能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前模型（如GPT-4o和Claude-2.7-Sonnet）在隐私分类和多轮对话中表现不佳，隐私泄露率较高，且多代理系统任务完成率低。

Conclusion: 当前模型在上下文隐私保护和协作任务解决方面尚未达到理想水平，亟需改进。

Abstract: The proliferation of LLM-based agents has led to increasing deployment of
inter-agent collaboration for tasks like scheduling, negotiation, resource
allocation etc. In such systems, privacy is critical, as agents often access
proprietary tools and domain-specific databases requiring strict
confidentiality. This paper examines whether LLM-based agents demonstrate an
understanding of contextual privacy. And, if instructed, do these systems
preserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn
conversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents
primarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information
can be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158
real-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed
such that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet
unrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then
evaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of
contextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without
violating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,
including GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual
privacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\% and 43.6\% of the
time. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in
59.9\% and 50.5\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.
Furthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\% of scenarios.
These results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both
contextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving.

### [3] [Dynamic Context-Aware Prompt Recommendation for Domain-Specific AI Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20815)
*Xinye Tang,Haijun Zhai,Chaitanya Belwal,Vineeth Thayanithi,Philip Baumann,Yogesh K Roy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态上下文感知的提示推荐系统，用于领域特定的AI应用，结合多种技术生成相关且可操作的提示建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM应用对用户提示质量高度敏感，而领域特定应用中高质量提示的编写尤为困难，因此需要一种动态的提示推荐系统。

Method: 结合上下文查询分析、检索增强的知识基础、分层技能组织和自适应技能排名，利用行为遥测和两阶段分层推理动态选择和排名技能，并通过预定义和自适应模板生成提示。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在自动和专家评估中均表现出高实用性和相关性。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效提升领域特定AI应用中提示的质量和实用性。

Abstract: LLM-powered applications are highly susceptible to the quality of user
prompts, and crafting high-quality prompts can often be challenging especially
for domain-specific applications. This paper presents a novel dynamic
context-aware prompt recommendation system for domain-specific AI applications.
Our solution combines contextual query analysis, retrieval-augmented knowledge
grounding, hierarchical skill organization, and adaptive skill ranking to
generate relevant and actionable prompt suggestions.
  The system leverages behavioral telemetry and a two-stage hierarchical
reasoning process to dynamically select and rank relevant skills, and
synthesizes prompts using both predefined and adaptive templates enhanced with
few-shot learning. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves high usefulness and relevance, as validated by both automated
and expert evaluations.

### [4] [Beyond Reactive Safety: Risk-Aware LLM Alignment via Long-Horizon Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20949)
*Chenkai Sun,Denghui Zhang,ChengXiang Zhai,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种框架，用于评估语言模型建议在宏观社会系统中的长期影响，并引入了一个间接危害场景数据集，以测试模型对潜在不良结果的预见能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在高风险社会决策中的影响力增加，确保其建议的正面影响需要理解其长期宏观影响。

Method: 提出了一个概念验证框架，用于模拟模型建议在社会系统中的传播，并引入了一个包含100个间接危害场景的数据集。

Result: 该方法在新数据集上实现了超过20%的提升，并在现有安全基准测试中平均胜率超过70%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更安全的语言模型代理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks
(AdvBench, SafeRLHF, WildGuardMix), suggesting a promising direction for safer
agents.

### [5] [Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21215)
*Haoang Chi,He Li,Wenjing Yang,Feng Liu,Long Lan,Xiaoguang Ren,Tongliang Liu,Bo Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的因果推理能力，发现其仅能进行浅层（level-1）推理，缺乏人类深层（level-2）能力。通过新基准CausalProbe-2024验证，并提出G^2-Reasoner方法提升LLMs的因果推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否具备类似人类的真实因果推理能力，填补其与人类推理能力之间的差距。

Method: 分析LLMs的自回归机制，提出新基准CausalProbe-2024，并设计G^2-Reasoner方法结合通用知识和目标导向提示。

Result: LLMs在CausalProbe-2024上表现显著下降，G^2-Reasoner显著提升了其在新鲜和反事实情境中的推理能力。

Conclusion: G^2-Reasoner为LLMs迈向深层因果推理提供了新路径，但仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models
(LLMs) toward strong artificial intelligence. While versatile LLMs appear to
have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and
providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether
they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence
indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing
shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal
knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine
human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,
methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of
transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.
Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,
whose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs
exhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier
benchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal
reasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw
inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by
general knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that
incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal
reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly
enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and
counterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to
advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making
strides towards level-2.

### [6] [World-aware Planning Narratives Enhance Large Vision-Language Model Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21230)
*Junhao Shi,Zhaoye Fei,Siyin Wang,Qipeng Guo,Jingjing Gong,Xipeng QIu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WAP的框架，通过四种认知能力增强大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的环境理解能力，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在复杂场景中表现不佳，主要依赖环境无关的模仿学习，导致无法处理上下文敏感的指令。

Method: WAP框架通过视觉外观建模、空间推理、功能抽象和语法接地四种能力，结合课程学习，仅使用原始视觉观察进行训练和评估。

Result: 在EB-ALFRED基准测试中，Qwen2.5-VL的任务成功率提升了60.7%，尤其在常识推理（+60.0）和长时程规划（+70.0）方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 增强后的开源模型显著优于GPT-4o和Claude-3.5-Sonnet等专有系统。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for embodied planning tasks
but struggle with complex scenarios involving unfamiliar environments and
multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon
interactions. In this work, we propose World-Aware Planning Narrative
Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet by a large margin.

### [7] [IXAII: An Interactive Explainable Artificial Intelligence Interface for Decision Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21310)
*Pauline Speckmann,Mario Nadj,Christian Janiesch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IXAII是一个交互式可解释AI系统，整合了LIME、SHAP、Anchors和DiCE四种方法，支持五种用户群体的定制化视图，并通过专家和普通用户访谈验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后可解释AI方法多为静态且忽视用户视角，限制了其实际效果。

Method: 开发了交互式系统IXAII，整合四种可解释方法，提供定制化视图和用户控制权。

Result: IXAII通过多重视觉化选项和不同解释方式，被认为能有效提升透明度。

Conclusion: IXAII为AI解释实践和人机交互提供了新视角，填补了方法、交互性和实际应用间的空白。

Abstract: Although several post-hoc methods for explainable AI have been developed,
most are static and neglect the user perspective, limiting their effectiveness
for the target audience. In response, we developed the interactive explainable
intelligent system called IXAII that offers explanations from four explainable
AI methods: LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and DiCE. Our prototype provides tailored
views for five user groups and gives users agency over the explanations'
content and their format. We evaluated IXAII through interviews with experts
and lay users. Our results indicate that IXAII, which provides different
explanations with multiple visualization options, is perceived as helpful to
increase transparency. By bridging the gaps between explainable AI methods,
interactivity, and practical implementation, we provide a novel perspective on
AI explanation practices and human-AI interaction.

### [8] [Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21329)
*Karthik Duraisamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AI驱动的科学发现需解决抽象、推理和现实三大差距，而非依赖模型规模或数据量。通过主动推理AI系统，结合因果自监督模型、贝叶斯规划器和知识图谱，实现闭环验证与人类判断的融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在科学发现中存在局限，如架构僵化、推理脆弱及脱离实验现实。论文旨在通过解决三大差距，推动AI在科学领域的实质性进展。

Method: 构建主动推理AI系统，包括因果自监督模型、贝叶斯规划器、知识图谱，并通过闭环实验与模拟验证内部模型。

Result: 提出一种结合内部模型与外部验证的架构，强调人类判断在不确定性中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 科学发现的AI系统需融合内部推理与外部验证，并永久依赖人类判断以应对不确定性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.

### [9] [TableMoE: Neuro-Symbolic Routing for Structured Expert Reasoning in Multimodal Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21393)
*Junwen Zhang,Pu Chen,Yin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TableMoE提出了一种神经符号混合专家架构，用于多模态表格数据的鲁棒结构化推理，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态大语言模型在复杂表格结构、符号密度和视觉退化条件下的性能局限和泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 采用神经符号路由机制，动态分配表格元素到专家模块（如Table-to-HTML），并引入大规模对齐数据集TableMoE-Align进行预训练。

Result: 在WildStruct基准测试中表现优异，验证了神经符号路由和结构化专家对齐的核心作用。

Conclusion: TableMoE通过神经符号推理有效提升了多模态表格理解的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due
to the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,
skew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or
hierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited
performance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture
specifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table
data. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which
predicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)
and dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,
Table-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed
by symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven
pretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of
1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and
industry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate
and release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,
WMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models
under real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental
results demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core
component, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and
structured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase
TableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the
effectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table
understanding.

TL;DR: MindCube基准测试揭示了现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在构建空间心理模型方面的不足，并提出了一种协同方法“map-then-reason”显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究VLMs是否能像人类一样通过少量视角构建完整的空间心理模型，以推理布局、视角和运动。

Method: 使用MindCube基准测试评估VLMs的空间心理模型能力，并提出三种方法（中间视角、自然语言推理链、认知地图），最终采用“map-then-reason”协同方法。

Result: 通过“map-then-reason”方法，准确率从37.8%提升至60.8%；加入强化学习后进一步提升至70.7%。

Conclusion: 构建并利用内部结构化空间表示的空间心理模型支架，显著提升了对不可观测空间的理解能力。

Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2)，通过开发人类代理代理解决Hanabi游戏中人类评估的高成本和难以复现问题，并开源了一个有限的人类游戏数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI代理与人类在现实应用中无缝协调的挑战，尤其是Hanabi游戏中人类评估的高成本和难以复现问题。

Method: 开发人类代理代理作为评估伙伴，开源有限的人类游戏数据集，并在两玩家和三玩家Hanabi场景中提供基线结果。

Result: 提出了AH2AC2挑战，开发了人类代理代理，并开源了3,079局游戏的数据集。

Conclusion: AH2AC2为人类-AI协调研究提供了廉价、可复现的评估方法，推动了数据高效方法的发展。

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for
real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is
a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained
communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it
an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI
interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this
work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to
overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human
evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human
dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation
partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we
open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of
available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and
three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy
agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them
publicly. The code is available at

TL;DR: Mind2Web 2是一个包含130个长周期任务的基准测试，用于评估自主网络搜索系统的性能，并提出了一种基于树形结构的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法应对自主搜索系统的复杂性和开放性，需要新的基准和评估方法。

Method: 提出Mind2Web 2基准和Agent-as-a-Judge框架，通过任务特定的代理评估答案正确性和来源归属。

Result: 最佳系统OpenAI Deep Research达到人类性能的50-70%，且耗时减半。

Conclusion: Mind2Web 2为下一代自主搜索系统的开发和评估提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Agentic search such as Deep Research systems, where large language models
autonomously browse the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive
citation-backed answers, represents a major shift in how users interact with
web-scale information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive
offloading, the growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have
outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume
short search horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web
2, a benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that
require real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed
with over 1,000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of nine frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, showing a great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web 2
provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

*Fangjun Ding,Renyu Zhang,Xinyu Feng,Chengye Xie,Zheng Zhang,Yanting Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PsyLite是一个基于InternLM2.5-7B-chat的轻量级心理咨询大语言模型，通过两阶段训练策略提升推理能力、咨询能力和对话安全性，并在资源受限环境中实现高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询模型在对话安全、场景处理和轻量化部署方面存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 采用混合蒸馏数据微调和ORPO偏好优化的两阶段训练策略，结合条件RAG引入幽默元素并增强安全性。

Result: 在CEval、CPsyCounE和SafeDialBench评估中表现优异，心理咨询专业性提升47.6%，对话安全性提升2.4%。

Conclusion: PsyLite为资源受限环境提供了高效的心理咨询解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological
counseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of
mental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue
safety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address
these issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological
counseling large language model agent developed based on the base model
InternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation
data fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the
model's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe
dialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom
workflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed
to introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological
counseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to
strengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the
baseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological
counseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation
(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism
(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\%) and dialogue safety (\safe{} score
improvement of 2.4\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology
(GGUF q4\_k\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient
for operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling
applications in resource-constrained environments.
