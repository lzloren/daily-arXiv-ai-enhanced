However, they often face challenges in\nacquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training\nparadigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement\nlearning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These\napproaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,\nlimiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing\ninspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the\npotential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\n  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI\nlearner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI\nteacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a\ncore mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend\nsolely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\n  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the\nAI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results\nindicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving\nmixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with\nlearner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to\nacquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional\ninstructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats\ntypically present in training datasets.\n  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological\ninsights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training\nknowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a\ncomplementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering"}

Conventional explainable AI approaches\noffer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic\ncollaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a\nphilosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks\nthat treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions\nAI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human\nconfidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and\nconfidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as\na formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is\nempirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's\nadaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive\nintervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It\nalso integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI\nbehavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring\ncommunication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,\ntogether with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human\nintelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in\ncollaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with\nhigh-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the\nprotocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of\nAI decision-making."}

While existing evaluation\nmethods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general\napproach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology\ncontent degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these\neffects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce\nMNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight\nframework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME\ncompares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The\nPile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral\nshifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,\nemergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent\naccuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and\nrequiring no custom heuristics.

This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a\ngeneralization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models\nto more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD\nintegrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus\npenalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate\neffectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables\ncontrollable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or\ncontent biases.

Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct\nservers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU\nidleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our\nempirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request\narrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel\ntraining. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for\nco-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix\nintegrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime\nscheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload\ncharacteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors\nand co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization\nand serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation\nshows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by\nup to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over\ntraditional separate setups.

Our results showed that\nclinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance\nin high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are\nlimited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also\nleads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were\nconsistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This\nsuggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance\nand are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is\noptimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports\nrather than creating rationales.

Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with\nmaintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder\nframework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology\ntraversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel\ndecoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits\n(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language\njustifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two\nstreams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured\nknowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using\nprompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a\nsingle-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed\nontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification\nwith the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in\nturn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on\nuse cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search\nimprovement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that\nEvo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only\ndecoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.\nWe present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the\ncontributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router.

Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct\nservers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU\nidleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our\nempirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request\narrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel\ntraining. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for\nco-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix\nintegrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime\nscheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload\ncharacteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors\nand co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization\nand serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation\nshows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by\nup to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over\ntraditional separate setups.

We present\nReinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that\nuses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans\nlearn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several\nchain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final\nanswer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are\nthen used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,\nsimilar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally\ncurated rewards.\n  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --\nrestoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step\nreasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and\nmultiple-choice question answering.\n  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms\nreinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and\ndata-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further\nresearch in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training."}
