### [1] [ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777)
*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 符号回归（SR）用于揭示复杂物理系统中的可解释数学关系，结合知识表示框架（ASP）提高模型的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体力学中，理解流动物理与准确预测同样重要，SR无需先验模型假设，适合研究三维不可压缩流动。

Method: 使用PySR库从数值模拟数据中推导符号方程，并结合ASP框架确保物理合理性。

Result: SR生成的方程不仅近似模拟了抛物线速度分布和压力降，还与文献中的解析解完全一致。

Conclusion: SR能简化复杂流动行为为可解释方程，结合ASP可提高数据驱动模型的可靠性和领域一致性。

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

### [2] [I2I-STRADA -- Information to Insights via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17874)
*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: I2I-STRADA是一种基于结构化推理的代理架构，旨在通过模块化子任务模拟数据分析的认知步骤，提升规划一致性和洞察对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统在数据分析中忽视了结构化推理过程，而现实数据分析需要一致的认知工作流。

Method: 提出I2I-STRADA架构，通过模块化子任务模拟分析推理的认知步骤。

Result: 在DABstep和DABench基准测试中，I2I-STRADA在规划一致性和洞察对齐方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: 结构化认知工作流对数据分析代理设计至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

TL;DR: SmartAPS是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的对话系统，旨在为供应链规划师提供更易访问的高级规划系统（APS），通过自然语言界面实现查询、反事实推理、推荐和场景分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统APS系统因定制和维护成本高昂而难以普及，供应链规划师需要更易访问的工具。

Method: 利用工具增强的LLM构建SmartAPS，提供自然语言聊天界面。

Result: SmartAPS使操作规划师能够直观地查询信息、进行反事实推理、接收建议和执行场景分析。

Conclusion: SmartAPS通过LLM技术降低了APS的使用门槛，提升了操作规划的效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

### [4] [Synthesis of timeline-based planning strategies avoiding determinization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17988)
*Dario Della Monica,Angelo Montanari,Pietro Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种定性时间线规划的分支，其计划存在性问题可直接映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题，从而合成策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定性时间线规划的计划存在性问题是PSPACE完全的，但非确定性自动机无法直接用于合成策略，需要昂贵的确定性步骤。

Method: 识别一个定性时间线规划的分支，将其计划存在性问题映射到确定性有限自动机的非空性问题。

Result: 确定了适合该确定性分支的Allen关系的最大子集。

Conclusion: 通过确定性自动机直接合成策略，避免了非确定性自动机的复杂性。

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

### [5] [E.A.R.T.H.: Structuring Creative Evolution through Model Error in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18004)
*Yusen Peng,Shuhua Mao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出E.A.R.T.H.框架，通过错误生成、放大、精炼选择、转换和利用反馈五个阶段，将AI生成的错误转化为创意资产，显著提升创造力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何超越模仿实现真正的创造力，提出‘创意潜力隐藏在失败中’的理念。

Method: 采用五阶段生成管道（E.A.R.T.H.），结合结构化提示、语义评分和人类反馈，使用多种模型（如LLaMA-2-7B-Chat、SBERT等）和复合奖励函数。

Result: 创造力评分提升52.5%，最终输出提升70.4%；精炼后的标语更短、更新颖，跨模态测试显示强对齐性，人类评价中60%输出得分≥4.0。

Conclusion: 错误中心和反馈驱动的生成方法能有效增强AI创造力，为自进化、人类对齐的创意AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

### [6] [Does visualization help AI understand data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18022)
*Victoria R. Li,Johnathan Sun,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，图表能帮助AI系统更精确地分析数据，尤其是在复杂数据集上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨图表是否对AI系统分析数据有帮助。

Method: 使用GPT 4.1和Claude 3.5两种商业视觉语言模型，在三种代表性分析任务中测试图表对数据描述的精确性和准确性。

Result: 图表显著提升了AI系统的表现，尤其是在复杂数据集上。

Conclusion: 图表对AI系统的数据分析有积极影响，类似于其对人类的作用。

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

### [7] [Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18059)
*Yueheng Li,Guangming Xie,Zongqing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGPO提出了一种新的CTDE框架，通过结合集中式指导和分散式执行，优化了多智能体强化学习的性能，并在理论和实验上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTDE方法未能充分利用集中式训练或缺乏理论保证，MAGPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MAGPO采用自回归联合策略进行可扩展的协调探索，并明确对齐分散式策略以确保可部署性。

Result: 在43个任务和6个环境中，MAGPO表现优于现有CTDE基线，甚至媲美完全集中式方法。

Conclusion: MAGPO为分散式多智能体学习提供了理论支持且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

### [8] [AlphaGo Moment for Model Architecture Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18074)
*Yixiu Liu,Yang Nan,Weixian Xu,Xiangkun Hu,Lyumanshan Ye,Zhen Qin,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASI-Arch是首个用于AI研究的超级智能系统，通过自主进行神经架构创新，突破了人类认知限制，发现了106种先进的线性注意力架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI研究受限于人类认知能力，ASI-Arch旨在通过自主创新解决这一瓶颈。

Method: ASI-Arch采用自动化创新范式，自主提出架构概念、实现代码、训练并验证性能。

Result: 系统进行了1,773次实验，发现了106种SOTA架构，并揭示了新的设计原则。

Conclusion: ASI-Arch为AI研究的自主加速提供了蓝图，证明科学发现可通过计算扩展。

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

### [9] [Agentic AI framework for End-to-End Medical Data Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18115)
*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Shayan Vassef,Abhay Goyal,Navin Kumar,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化临床数据处理的Agentic AI框架，通过模块化代理从数据输入到推理全流程处理，减少人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域机器学习部署的高成本、碎片化预处理和隐私问题。

Method: 使用任务特定代理处理结构化和非结构化数据，自动完成特征选择、模型选择和预处理。

Result: 在老年医学、姑息治疗和结肠镜影像数据集上验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床环境中的AI部署提供了可扩展、高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

### [10] [Actively evaluating and learning the distinctions that matter: Vaccine safety signal detection from emergency triage notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18123)
*Sedigh Khademi,Christopher Palmer,Muhammad Javed,Hazel Clothier,Jim Buttery,Gerardo Luis Dimaguila,Jim Black*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究利用自然语言处理（NLP）和主动学习技术，开发了一种从急诊科分诊笔记中快速检测疫苗安全问题的分类器，以弥补临床试验中安全数据收集的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19疫苗快速开发后，需要建立许可后监测系统，以弥补临床试验中安全数据收集时间窗口的不足。急诊科分诊笔记提供了关键的患者信息，但传统的关键词分类方法效率低且易产生误报。

Method: 结合自然语言处理（NLP）、主动学习和数据增强技术，开发分类器，优化标注过程并提高模型性能。

Result: 研究提出了一种更准确、高效的分类器，用于从急诊科分诊笔记中检测疫苗安全问题。

Conclusion: 通过NLP和主动学习的结合，可以显著提升疫苗安全信号的监测效率和准确性。

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

### [11] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了使用均值聚合函数的图神经网络（GNNs）的表达能力，发现其在非均匀设置下与比率模态逻辑等价，而在均匀设置下与无交替模态逻辑等价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨均值聚合GNNs的表达能力，比较其与其他聚合函数（如max和sum）的差异。

Method: 在非均匀和均匀设置下分析均值GNNs的表达能力，并与模态逻辑和MSO（Monadic Second-Order Logic）进行对比。

Result: 非均匀设置下均值GNNs表达能力介于max和sum之间；均匀设置下其表达能力低于sum和max。

Conclusion: 均值GNNs的表达能力受设置和假设条件影响，灵活性较高，但严格低于sum和max聚合GNNs。

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [12] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种认知归因框架，将大语言模型（LLMs）的知识和推理能力解耦，通过快速和慢速思维模式分析其贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受双系统认知理论启发，研究旨在区分LLMs中知识和推理的作用，以提升模型分析、可解释性和开发。

Method: 通过分解LLMs的认知为知识检索（阶段1）和推理调整（阶段2），并在不同思维模式下生成答案以量化贡献。

Result: 研究发现推理调整具有领域特异性，参数规模提升知识和推理能力，且知识主要分布在网络低层，推理在高层。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅从解耦角度理解LLMs，还为现有研究（如规模定律、知识编辑和小模型推理限制）提供了新见解。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [13] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了四种不遵循模型最小化原则的析取语义，证明其中三种方法（Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛）实际上一致，且比第四种方法（Strongly Supported Models）更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究析取在Answer Set Programming中的非最小化语义，探索不同方法的异同及其与稳定模型的关系。

Method: 比较四种析取语义：Justified Models、Strongly Supported Models、Forks和DI语义，分析其定义和性质。

Result: 证明Forks、Justified Models和DI语义的合理松弛实际上一致，且比Strongly Supported Models更强。

Conclusion: 三种方法构成了一种共同的语义，且比第四种方法更强大，为析取语义的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

### [14] [Foundations for Risk Assessment of AI in Protecting Fundamental Rights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18290)
*Antonino Rotolo,Beatrice Ferrigno,Jose Miguel Angel Garcia Godinez,Claudio Novelli,Giovanni Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种定性风险评估框架，用于AI（特别是欧盟AI法案背景下），结合定义性平衡和可废止推理，解决法律合规与基本权利保护的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI部署中法律合规与基本权利保护的冲突，提供一种动态且可操作的风险评估方法。

Method: 采用定义性平衡（比例分析）和可废止推理，分析AI部署场景及其对基本权利的多层次影响。

Result: 提出了一个逻辑化的AI风险分析框架，适用于高风险AI和通用AI系统，强调后者的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 未来工作将开发正式模型和算法，以增强AI风险评估，支持负责任的AI治理。

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合计算机代数系统、SMT求解器和项重写系统的方法，利用大语言模型处理学生物理考试答案，并通过自动推理技术评估答案正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理考试中评估学生答案正确性的挑战性问题。

Method: 结合计算机代数系统、SMT求解器和项重写系统，利用大语言模型预处理学生答案，再通过自动定理证明技术评估正确性。

Result: 在2023年澳大利亚物理奥林匹克竞赛的1500多份真实学生答案上进行了评估。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，但项重写系统的开发和验证具有挑战性。

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域需要LLMs不仅具备事实准确性和逻辑推理能力，还需在不确定性下生成创造性和合理的未来情景。现有基准未能全面评估这些能力。

Method: 开发ConDiFi基准，包含发散思维（607个宏观金融提示）和收敛思维（990个多跳对抗性选择题）任务，评估14个领先LLMs。

Result: GPT-4o在新颖性和可操作性上表现不佳，而DeepSeek-R1和Cohere Command R+在生成可操作见解方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ConDiFi为评估LLMs在金融领域的安全和战略部署提供了新视角，揭示了模型在发散和收敛思维上的差异。

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

### [17] [Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391)
*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Kai Jia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息瓶颈（IB）原则的理论框架IBRO，用于优化大语言模型（LLM）的推理能力，并通过轻量级IB正则化方法提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LLM推理方法缺乏理论支持，限制了方法的发展。

Method: 提出IB-aware reasoning optimization（IBRO）框架，引入信息瓶颈原则，设计了一个实用的token级替代目标，并提出了高效的近似方法。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准和RL算法上验证了IB正则化的有效性，性能一致提升。

Conclusion: IBRO框架为LLM推理提供了理论支持，轻量级IB正则化方法易于集成且高效。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

TL;DR: 论文比较了基于模型（VI）和无模型（PPO）的强化学习方法在呼叫中心路由优化中的应用，PPO表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化呼叫中心的路由策略，减少客户等待时间和员工空闲时间。

Method: 比较了基于模型的Value Iteration（VI）和无模型的Proximal Policy Optimisation（PPO），使用MDP框架和SBR模型。

Result: PPO在1000次测试中表现最佳，奖励最高，客户等待时间和员工空闲时间最低。

Conclusion: PPO是呼叫中心路由优化的有效方法，尽管训练时间较长。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPU在处理包含数百或数千个有效案例的大规模表约束问题时效率不足，需要利用GPU的并行计算能力提升性能。

Method: 设计并实现了GPU加速的CT算法，并将其集成到现有的约束求解器中。

Result: 通过实验验证，GPU加速的CT算法在大量实例中表现出显著性能提升。

Conclusion: GPU加速的CT算法为处理大规模表约束问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

Result: 研究发现训练数据对概念探测模型性能有显著影响，并公开了两个数据集的标签。

Conclusion: 强调了训练数据在概念探测中的重要性，为未来研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Motivation: 解决现有对齐方法（如RLHF）仅学习人类偏好的局限性，开发具有内在安全推理和自我反思能力的AI模型。

Method: 采用SafeLadder框架，结合大规模、渐进式、安全导向的强化学习后训练，并辅以多原则验证器。

Result: SafeWork-R1在安全性基准上平均提升46.54%，且不损害通用能力，性能优于GPT-4.1和Claude Opus 4。

Conclusion: SafeLadder框架证明安全性与能力可协同进化，为构建可靠、可信的通用AI提供了通用方法。

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

TL;DR: Shop-R1是一个强化学习框架，通过分解人类行为模拟任务为两个阶段（理由生成和动作预测），并结合自监督和分层奖励结构，显著提升了LLM在在线购物环境中的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖于LLM生成的理性数据，但其性能受限于模型的推理能力。Shop-R1旨在通过强化学习框架提升LLM在模拟人类在线购物行为中的推理能力。

Method: Shop-R1将任务分解为理由生成和动作预测两个阶段，分别采用自监督信号和分层奖励结构（难度感知缩放）来优化推理和动作预测。

Result: 实验结果显示，Shop-R1相比基线方法实现了65%以上的相对性能提升。

Conclusion: Shop-R1通过创新的强化学习框架和分层奖励设计，显著提升了LLM在模拟人类行为中的推理能力，为类似任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: DG-PRM提出了一种动态且可泛化的过程奖励建模方法，通过奖励树和多维奖励标准提升LLM在复杂任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM依赖启发式方法，跨领域泛化能力不足，且静态评估标准难以适应复杂过程监督。

Method: DG-PRM采用奖励树存储细粒度奖励标准，动态选择奖励信号，并首次使用Pareto优势估计处理多维度奖励。

Result: 实验显示DG-PRM在主流基准测试中表现优异，显著提升模型性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DG-PRM为复杂任务中的过程奖励建模提供了高效且泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助缺乏统计背景的用户在使用自然语言数据库接口时避免认知偏差，提升分析问题的质量。

Method: 引入三个创新：上下文语义映射框架、基于Hard-to-Vary原则的分析框架、优化的LLM系统生成高质量提示。

Result: 82.5%用户认为系统提升了分析质量；在比较评估中，VeriMinder在具体性、全面性和准确性上至少高出20%。

Conclusion: VeriMinder能有效帮助用户避免分析中的“错误问题”漏洞，其开源代码和提示库可促进进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the

Conclusion: 该方法高效、实用，适用于大规模语言学习系统，且在数据不平衡情况下表现优异。

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及，AI生成文本的检测成为重要问题。然而，现有研究对新兴LLM（如DeepSeek）的检测能力存在空白。

Method: 研究使用六种AI检测工具测试DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力，并应用标准及人类化改写等对抗攻击。同时，探索了DeepSeek自身作为检测器的潜力。

Result: QuillBot和Copyleaks在原始及改写文本上表现优异，而人类化攻击显著降低了检测器的准确率。DeepSeek通过少样本提示和链式思考推理表现出高准确率。

Conclusion: 检测工具对DeepSeek生成文本的识别能力因工具和攻击类型而异，人类化攻击对检测器影响最大，而DeepSeek自身作为检测器具有潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

Result: 更大、更强大的预训练语言模型的信念更新更符合贝叶斯定理。

Conclusion: 研究结果对理解和治理大型语言模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

incorporating a continual pretraining phase with domain-specific datasets,
combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in code

TL;DR: 论文提出NeuralDB框架，通过神经键值数据库和非线性门控检索模块高效编辑大语言模型中的知识，同时保持模型通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有线性L&E方法在编辑大量事实时可能损害模型通用能力或导致遗忘的问题。

Method: 将线性L&E方法建模为键值数据库查询，提出NeuralDB框架，利用非线性门控检索模块仅在涉及编辑事实时操作。

Result: 在10,000事实编辑实验中，NeuralDB在编辑效果、泛化性、特异性、流畅性和一致性上表现优异，且不影响模型在六项任务中的性能。

Conclusion: NeuralDB能高效编辑大规模事实（100,000条），同时保持模型通用能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

TL;DR: GrAInS是一种基于梯度的推理时引导方法，通过识别关键令牌并调整隐藏激活，优化语言和视觉语言模型的行为，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定干预向量，忽视输入令牌的因果影响和梯度信息，尤其在多模态任务中表现不足。

Method: GrAInS利用对比梯度归因识别关键令牌，构建方向性引导向量，并在推理时调整隐藏激活。

Result: GrAInS在TruthfulQA、MMHal-Bench和SPA-VL任务中显著优于微调和现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GrAInS提供细粒度、可解释的模型行为控制，同时保持模型的流畅性和通用能力。

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成合成短语断句标注，减少人工标注需求，并在多语言中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前短语断句预测方法依赖大量人工标注，成本高且数据一致性难以保证，LLM在NLP中成功解决数据问题，启发其在语音领域的应用。

Method: 通过LLM生成合成短语断句标注，与传统人工标注对比，评估其在多语言中的效果。

Result: LLM生成的合成数据有效缓解了短语断句预测中的数据挑战。

Conclusion: LLM在语音领域具有潜力，可作为解决数据问题的可行方案。

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估SLMs是否能完成复杂任务，而忽略了用户在实际对话中的自然交互需求。

Method: TELEVAL定义了三个评估维度（显式语义、副语言和隐式语义、系统能力），采用对话格式，并分别评估文本和音频输出。

Result: 实验表明，现有SLMs在自然对话任务中仍有较大改进空间。

Conclusion: TELEVAL旨在作为以用户为中心的评估框架，推动对话导向SLMs的发展。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLMs）的微调因计算和内存需求高而成为瓶颈，需要更高效的微调方法。

Method: 结合BOFT和LoRA-GA的混合策略，通过梯度范数指导的逐层自适应更新，并首次将uRNN原理应用于基于Transformer的LLMs。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，混合方法优于单独PEFT基线，接近全微调精度，同时减少训练时间2.1倍和内存使用50%。

Conclusion: 混合方法为资源受限的LLMs实际部署提供了实用且可扩展的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Motivation: 2014版GloVe模型虽广泛使用，但语言和世界在变化，且原模型文档不完整，需更新并完善文档。

Method: 使用Wikipedia、Gigaword和Dolma子集训练两组词嵌入，并通过词汇对比、直接测试和NER任务评估。

Conclusion: 2024版GloVe模型更新且文档完善，适用于当前语言需求。

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在基于代码的多模态数学推理中的能力，重点关注代码生成和编辑任务，发现现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上仍远落后于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本推理输出，而MLLMs通过代码执行准确视觉操作的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出一个评估框架，包括多模态代码生成（MCG）和多模态代码编辑（MCE），并利用涵盖五种数学图形的数据集进行测试。

Result: 实验涉及九种主流MLLMs，结果显示现有模型在细粒度视觉操作上表现显著低于人类。

Conclusion: MLLMs在基于代码的多模态数学推理中仍有较大改进空间，尤其是在细粒度视觉操作方面。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

Motivation: HIV管理的复杂性使其成为LLMs应用的理想案例，但临床实践中对准确性、潜在危害和接受度的担忧尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究开发了HIVMedQA基准测试，评估了7个通用和3个医学专用LLMs，结合提示工程和临床相关性的评估框架。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳，但性能随问题复杂性下降；医学微调模型不一定优于通用模型，推理和理解是主要挑战。

Conclusion: 需针对性开发和评估以确保LLMs在临床中的安全有效应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粘性标记的存在影响了嵌入模型的可靠性和下游任务性能，需要系统研究和解决。

Method: 提出了一种基于句子和标记过滤的检测方法STD，并应用于40个模型检查点。

Result: 发现868个粘性标记，其来源多为特殊词汇或未使用的条目，且与模型大小无关。下游任务性能下降高达50%。

Conclusion: 需改进标记化策略和模型设计以减少粘性标记的影响。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在多选题任务中可能通过利用选项位置或标签的固有偏差来获得虚高分数，而非真正理解内容。

Method: SCOPE通过重复调用无语义内容的空提示，估计模型的独特位置偏差分布，并按逆偏差分布重新分配答案位置，同时阻止语义相近的干扰项相邻。

Result: 在多个基准实验中，SCOPE在稳定性能提升和更清晰的置信度分布方面优于现有去偏方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE为提升LLM评估的公平性和可靠性提供了新标准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,

regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG依赖外部知识库可能被攻击者注入有害文档，导致误导性输出，因此需要一种高效防御方法。

Method: GMTP通过分析检索器相似度函数的梯度识别关键令牌，利用掩码语言模型检查其概率，检测低概率令牌以过滤恶意文档。

Result: 实验表明，GMTP能消除90%以上的恶意内容，同时保留相关文档，保持检索和生成的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GMTP是一种高效防御方法，能显著减少对抗性攻击对RAG系统的影响。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 指令微调提升大语言模型（LLM）遵循用户指令的能力，但也增加了对用户输入的依赖，可能导致错误信息的接受和幻觉生成。研究发现指令微调显著增加LLM对错误信息的接受度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨指令微调对LLM接受错误信息的影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 比较指令微调模型与基础模型对错误信息的接受度，分析用户角色、提示结构等因素的影响。

Result: 指令微调模型更易接受用户提供的错误信息，依赖用户输入增加。

Conclusion: 需系统性方法减少指令微调的负面影响，提升LLM在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

TL;DR: Prune&Comp是一种无需训练的层剪枝方法，通过幅度补偿减少隐藏状态差距，显著提升剪枝后模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪除层会导致隐藏状态幅度差距，进而引起性能下降，需要一种训练自由的补偿方法。

Method: 提出Prune&Comp，通过离线重新缩放剩余权重补偿幅度差距，无运行时开销。

Result: 剪除LLaMA-3-8B的5层后，困惑度减半，保留93.19%的问答性能，优于基线4.01%。

Conclusion: Prune&Comp是一种高效且无需训练的层剪枝方案，显著提升剪枝模型性能。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音翻译模型在术语翻译上存在困难，现有方法无法充分利用翻译知识且易受噪声干扰。

Method: 提出Locate-and-Focus方法：1) 定位术语片段以构建翻译知识；2) 关联音频和文本模态的翻译知识与假设。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效定位术语并提升翻译成功率，同时保持整体翻译性能。

Conclusion: Locate-and-Focus方法显著改善了术语翻译效果，为语音翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言（LRL）使用独特脚本时的OCR问题，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 比较六种OCR引擎（包括商业和开源系统）在Sinhala和Tamil上的零样本性能，使用五种测量技术评估字符和单词级别的准确性。

Result: Surya在Sinhala上表现最佳（WER 2.61%），Document AI在Tamil上表现最优（CER 0.78%）。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言的OCR性能提供了基准，并引入了一个新的合成Tamil OCR数据集。

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业沟通中需要LLMs适应特定风格（如品牌声音或作者语调），但缺乏指令-响应格式的语料库难以实现。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器在基础模型上训练多样非结构化风格语料，再与指令跟随模型合并。

Result: 实验显示风格一致性和指令遵循性均提升，人类评估确认品牌风格吸收。

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM为LLMs风格个性化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Result: 实验证明该方法能可靠地增加推理过程的长度，且不影响最终答案的正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LRMs的安全性研究提供了新视角，展示了可控资源消耗攻击的可行性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

Motivation: 研究动机是解决机器翻译中性别标记不明确时模型依赖刻板印象的问题，并探讨模型在性别模糊时应如何表现不确定性。

Method: 使用语义不确定性度量方法，分析模型在性别明确和模糊时的翻译表现及去偏方法的影响。

Result: 研究发现，翻译和性别准确性高的模型在性别模糊时未能表现出足够的不确定性，且去偏方法对模糊和明确实例的影响独立。

Conclusion: 结论指出，模型在性别模糊时应保持不确定性，且去偏方法需针对不同情况分别优化。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TDR的新框架，通过解耦多任务数据集中的示例并利用LLM的细粒度反馈，提升了ICL中示例检索的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICL中示例检索的两个主要挑战：跨任务数据分布区分困难，以及检索器输出与LLM反馈之间的细粒度连接不足。

Method: 提出TDR框架，解耦多任务数据集中的示例，并利用LLM的细粒度反馈指导检索模块训练。

Result: 在30个NLP任务上的实验表明，TDR显著提升了性能，并达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TDR是一种即插即用的方法，可轻松结合多种LLM提升ICL示例检索能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

Motivation: 社交媒体上的宣传检测任务复杂且高质量标注数据有限，亟需一种既能保证标注一致性又能提高效率的方法。

Method: 1. 提出分层分类法组织14种细粒度宣传技术；2. 进行人工标注研究；3. 设计LLM辅助预标注流程；4. 通过知识蒸馏训练小模型。

Result: LLM辅助显著提高了标注一致性和时间效率，小模型通过LLM生成的高质量数据学习表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发可扩展且鲁棒的宣传检测系统提供了新思路，支持透明和负责任的媒体生态系统。

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Motivation: 当前LLM评估通常只提供单一分数或排名，缺乏具体原因分析，CLEAR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: CLEAR生成实例级反馈，识别系统级错误问题，并通过交互式仪表板提供可视化分析。

Result: CLEAR在RAG和数学基准测试中展示了其分析能力，并通过用户案例验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: CLEAR为LLM评估提供了更深入、可操作的分析工具，有助于理解模型性能的具体原因。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

Motivation: 由于阿拉伯语在表格数据上的公共资源有限且语言特性独特，现有基准测试不足，AraTable旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用混合方法，先由LLMs生成内容，再经人工专家过滤和验证，确保数据集质量。同时提出自动化评估框架。

Result: LLMs在简单任务（如直接问答）表现尚可，但在复杂推理和事实验证上仍有挑战。自动化评估框架性能接近人工评判。

Conclusion: AraTable为阿拉伯语结构化数据处理提供了宝贵资源和评估框架，有助于未来改进复杂推理任务。

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia

post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in

Conclusion: FinDPO是首个在金融领域结合情感分析和实际投资策略的框架，表现出卓越的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIIFT是一种两阶段图引导的归纳式无图像多模态机器翻译框架，通过跨模态图注意力网络适配器学习多模态知识，并在无图像翻译领域实现泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMT方法在利用视觉信息时面临模态差距和领域限制的挑战。

Method: 构建多模态场景图以保留模态特定信息，并引入GIIFT框架，利用跨模态图注意力网络适配器学习多模态知识。

Result: 在Multi30K和WMT基准测试中，GIIFT表现优于现有方法，甚至无需图像即可实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: GIIFT展示了在无图像翻译领域的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

TL;DR: AQuilt框架通过逻辑和自检增强领域特定指令调优数据生成，显著降低成本并提升任务相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在专业领域表现不佳及现有数据合成方法成本高、泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出AQuilt框架，利用未标注数据生成指令调优数据，包含答案、问题、逻辑、自检和任务类型等模块。

Result: 构建了70.3万条数据，性能媲美DeepSeek-V3，成本仅为其17%，且数据与下游任务相关性更高。

Conclusion: AQuilt为专业领域提供高效、低成本的数据合成解决方案，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraDe方法通过引入稀疏依赖图优化LLM的注意力机制，显著提升复杂表格数据生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据中存在稀疏特征依赖，而LLM的自注意力机制会分散关注点，导致关键关系被忽略。

Method: 提出GraDe方法，通过动态图学习模块显式整合稀疏依赖图，优化注意力分配。

Result: 在复杂数据集上性能提升12%，在合成数据质量上达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: GraDe是一种轻量且高效的方法，为LLM在表格数据建模中提供了结构感知的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Moral foundation detection is crucial for analyzing social discourse and
developing ethically-aligned AI systems. While large language models excel
across diverse tasks, their performance on specialized moral reasoning remains
unclear.
  This study provides the first comprehensive comparison between
state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned transformers across Twitter and Reddit
datasets using ROC, PR, and DET curve analysis.
  Results reveal substantial performance gaps, with LLMs exhibiting high false
negative rates and systematic under-detection of moral content despite prompt
engineering efforts. These findings demonstrate that task-specific fine-tuning
remains superior to prompting for moral reasoning applications.

a novel approach designed to handle nested named entities while integrating
multiple datasets through an effective multi-task learning strategy. SRU-NER
mitigates annotation gaps by dynamically adjusting loss computation to avoid

extensive experiments, including a cross-corpus evaluation and human assessment
of the model's predictions, SRU-NER achieves competitive performance in
biomedical and general-domain NER tasks, while improving cross-domain
generalization.

*Ganesh Sapkota,Md Hasibur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合6-mer和BPE-600的混合分词策略，显著提升了DNA语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统k-mer分词在捕捉局部DNA序列结构时表现良好，但存在分词分布不均和全局上下文理解不足的问题。

Method: 通过将6-mer分词与600次BPE循环生成的BPE分词结合，构建平衡且上下文感知的词汇表。

Result: 模型在3-mer、4-mer和5-mer预测任务中分别达到10.78%、10.1%和4.12%的准确率，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 混合分词策略能同时捕捉局部和全局DNA序列特征，为基因组语言建模和下游应用奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

*Feng Hong,Geng Yu,Yushi Ye,Haicheng Huang,Huangjie Zheng,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Jiangchao Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WINO的训练免费解码算法，用于解决扩散大语言模型（DLLMs）在并行生成中的质量与速度权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DLLMs在快速并行解码时存在性能显著下降的问题，主要原因是标准解码的不可逆性导致错误方向极化。

Method: WINO采用并行草稿-验证机制，通过双向上下文验证并重新掩码可疑标记以优化解码。

Result: 在LLaDA和MMaDA等开源DLLMs上验证，WINO显著改善了质量与速度的权衡，例如在GSM8K数学基准上加速6倍且准确率提升2.58%。

Conclusion: WINO通过可撤销的解码机制有效解决了DLLMs的质量与速度矛盾，展示了其优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

Result: 在GSMHard和MATH等数学数据集上，TRPrompt生成的查询特定提示达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRPrompt成功统一了两种提示优化方法，并通过文本反馈实现了高效的提示模型训练，为LLM推理能力的提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于清单反馈的强化学习方法（RLCF），通过动态评估指令完成情况来优化语言模型的指令跟随能力，显著提升了多个基准测试的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法通常使用固定的评估标准（如“有用性”和“无害性”），限制了其对多样化指令的适应能力。RLCF旨在通过动态、指令特定的评估标准，提升语言模型对复杂指令的理解和响应能力。

Method: RLCF从指令中提取清单，结合AI评估和专用验证程序，动态计算奖励以优化强化学习过程。该方法在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型上进行了测试。

Result: RLCF在五个基准测试中均表现优异，包括FollowBench（硬满意度提升4点）、InFoBench（提升6点）和Arena-Hard（胜率提升3点）。

Conclusion: 清单反馈是一种有效工具，可显著提升语言模型对多样化指令的响应能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.
