Prior work has\nexplored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can\nimprove downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning\nability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping\nenvironments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation\ntask into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided\nby distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward\nstructure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable\nfine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action\ntypes and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and\nvalues), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental\nresults show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%\ncompared to the baseline."}

Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by\ngenerating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.\nMotivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break\nannotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and\nspeech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing\neffectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based\nsynthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break\nprediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the\nspeech domain."}

By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively\nincentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ntrajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,\nexisting approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the\ndevelopment of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a\ntheoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information\nbottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),\na framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about\nthe final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a\npractical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient\napproximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This\ntechnique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks\nwithout additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code\nmodification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent\nimprovements in LLM reasoning performance."}

From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an\nediting framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV\ndatabase equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,\nour gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,\neffectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments\ninvolving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and\nCounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results\ndemonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,\nspecificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance\nacross six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further\nexperiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled\nto 100,000 facts (\\textbf{50x} more than in prior work)."}

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities."}

It is developed by our\nproposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,\nsafety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of\nmulti-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and\ncapability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of\nour framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI."}
