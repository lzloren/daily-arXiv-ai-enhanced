Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)\nprovide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which\nprovide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a\nframework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate\ncontextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.\nUsing advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from\ngeneral KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph\nmodel to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,\nwe employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to\njointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,\nfully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In\nexperiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG\ndemonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across\nmultiple evaluation metrics.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural\nlanguage processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these\nmodels has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential\nbiases in their performance across different languages.\n  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,\nLLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and\nCommand R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,\nand Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese\nfrom the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\\'inicas da\nFaculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest\nhealth complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked\nagainst human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of\nthe generated explanations.\n  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and\nClaude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,\nperformance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image\ninterpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,\nemphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for\nnon-English medical AI applications.\n  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various\nlinguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in\nhealthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,\nimproved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven\nmedical assistance."}

A\ncritical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward\nmodel, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially\nunstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that\nintegrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,\neliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based\nguidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM\nfine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward\nmodel dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference\ndistribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the\npreference-based guidance model.

While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates\nthis process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows\nlinearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a\nbottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,\nincluding token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been\nproposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This\npaper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages\nthe observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the\nremoval of less critical KV entries to save memory.

To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{CaliDrop}, a\nnovel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration.

However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations\nexhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align\nwell with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a\ndouble-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of\nvarying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.\n  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and\nanalyze their utility across diverse DNNs.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was\nhigh (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference\nwith the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT\n(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels\non par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT\nsupervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for\nlarge-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o."}
