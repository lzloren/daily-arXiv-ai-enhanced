Analyzing\nthe internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct\non a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False\noutput is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the\ninternal representation.

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic\nunderstanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic\nwe need AI models to be and when."}

Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are\nstable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and\nbody behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to\nmodel personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed\nimpossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called\n\\textit{\\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs\n\\textit{\\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level\npersonality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a\n\\textit{\\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text\nsemantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To\nbe specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease\ndimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for\neffective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve\ngeneralization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to\napply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in\nextracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.\nFurthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features\nfurther improves the accuracy.

However, harnessing\nthe power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires\nformulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to\nautomatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus\nbridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated\narchitecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about\nthe relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in\nmanufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we\nevaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate\ninformation retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,\nparticularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core\nInformation Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding\nrelevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in\ntransforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that\nLLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and\ncomplete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema.

To address these issues, we\npropose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical\nGuidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health\nRecords. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs\ninto patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range\ndependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these\nreal-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.\nThis approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by\ngenerating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.\nWe validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private\nChinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these\ndiverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including\nleading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods.

Combining these\ncomponents yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track\nof the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB).

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the \"hard systematicity\nchallenge.\" However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be\nregulated by the rationales for systematization.
