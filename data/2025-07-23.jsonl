However, the\ntheoretical foundations of learning from CoT data remain underdeveloped, and\nexisting approaches -- such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) --\noften fail on complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we identify core obstacles\nthat hinder effective CoT learning, including distribution drift, lack of\nembedded search, and exponential inference costs. We introduce the Diligent\nLearner, a new learning paradigm that explicitly models reasoning as a\ndepth-first search guided by a validator and supports backtracking upon\nfailure. Under two mild and realistic assumptions, we prove that the Diligent\nLearner can efficiently learn from CoT data while existing methods fail to do\nso. This framework offers a path toward building scalable and reliable\nreasoning systems trained on naturally occurring, incomplete data -- paving the\nway for the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with robust,\ninterpretable problem-solving abilities."}

Williams"], "title": "The Recursive Coherence Principle: A Formal Constraint on Scalable Intelligence, Alignment, and Reasoning Architecture", "comment": null, "summary": "Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural\ncoherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale."}

The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an\nattention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of\nbike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the\ntemporal characteristic of bike station traffic.

This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean\nof human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,\nand subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures.

Building on these insights, we propose a\nhallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer\nevolution of hidden states.

Furthermore, using topic models\nalong with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an\neffective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale\nbehind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM\ncaptures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic\nmodel obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents\nas a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic\nmodel to extract features from text documents which are used to train a\nclassification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of\nthe features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in\ngeneral. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate\nconvolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise\nattention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by\nweighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform\ncomprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using\nthe features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification\nperformance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM.

Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification.

Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states\npredominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their\ndynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this\nlimitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce\na novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),\nwhich quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We\nempirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in\ndistinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a\nhallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer\nevolution of hidden states.

We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such\nself-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction\nmainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather\nthan misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of\nleveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model\nunderstanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the\ngeneration-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and\nunderstanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known\nin pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows\nimprovements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously\nincorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned\ntraining dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced\nprompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the\nunderstanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of\nco-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is\nempirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics\nlike Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,\nwhich highlights the necessity of data quality check.

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely\ncollected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the\nearly detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over\ntime. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to\noutputting classification results without providing a rationale for their\ndiagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot\nunderstand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and\nadoption.
