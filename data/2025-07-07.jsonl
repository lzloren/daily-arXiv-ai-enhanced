While AI agents\noffer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,\nlimiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a\nself-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA\nrepresents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and\ngrow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical\ndiscovery."}

Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,\nrequiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously\nadapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is\nparticularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward\noutcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying\ncomputational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's\nbehaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such\ncomputational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in\nthe real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for\nagentic AI interacting with humans online.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately.

Furthermore, they\nexhibit distinctive and persistent \"strategic fingerprints\": Google's Gemini\nmodels proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and\nretaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly\ncooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.\nAnthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing\nremarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or\nsuccessfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by\nthe models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and\ntheir opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is\ninstrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with\nmachine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic\ndecision-making under uncertainty."}

Hardware design verification entails a methodical\nand disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off\nof functionally correct hardware designs.

The field of Natural\nLanguage Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent\nof Large Language Models (LLMs).

This paper presents an\nagentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI\nagents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage\nin a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately\nperforming end-to-end hardware design and verification.

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs\nare primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)\nlike humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all\nreasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:\nCan we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon\nin LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and\nredundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes\nof model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined\nwith a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model\nenhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated\nreasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend\nredundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to\nidentify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more\nconcise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that\nTH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%\non hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability.

Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is\noften treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality\nin its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is\ncollected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and\ndomain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be\ntreated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and\ngrounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,\nlower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and\ncomputationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nDeveloping models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement\ndata will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and\ncontrol, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across\nbiological and artificial systems.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency.
