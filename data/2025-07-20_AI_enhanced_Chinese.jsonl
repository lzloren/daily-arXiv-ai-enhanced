What permits us to draw in globally relevant\ninformation and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that\npeople use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to\nconstruct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis.

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LMs\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u533a\u5206\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u80fd\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u6216\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LMs\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u7591LMs\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1LMs\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522bLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0LMs\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6309\u4e00\u81f4\u987a\u5e8f\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LMs\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We introduce a novel\nmulti-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized\nfeedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to\nenable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students\nto learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise\nfor exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized\nexercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in\neducation by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical\nagents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and\neffective systems for teaching mathematics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u8f85\u5bfc\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AI\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u88ab\u52a8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5ea6\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6559\u6750\u77e5\u8bc6\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u8f85\u5bfc\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f31\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u590d\u4e60\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3aAI\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

In this work, we\ndevelop byte-level LMs with learnable tokenizers to make tokenization adaptive.\nOur models include a submodule that learns to predict boundaries between the\ninput byte sequence, encoding it into variable-length segments.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24.

Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive\nSciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the\nbenefits of a semantically focused training approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "SemCSE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6458\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6458\u8981\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5fc5\u53cd\u6620\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u6587\u672c\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6458\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u62c9\u8fd1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6458\u8981\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSemCSE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u540c\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u805a\u7126\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "SemCSE\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Supplementary material included at end of article", "summary": "The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)\nnecessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to\nevaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the\nassumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their\nstochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that\ntraditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this\nmismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating\nMoral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater\nalignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We\nillustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous\npublic bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally\nsalient contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u65b0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u9053\u5fb7\u4ee3\u7406\uff08AMA\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u4f26\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f26\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u5df2\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5341\u9879\u529f\u80fd\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u9053\u5fb7\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8AMA\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u878d\u5408\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fee\u8ba2\u540e\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4e3aLLM-based AMA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u9053\u5fb7\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5GEA\uff08Generative Energy Arena\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002GEA\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u6e90\u610f\u8bc6\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7ade\u6280\u573a\uff08\u5982LM arena\uff09\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u548c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e86\u89e3\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u540e\uff0c\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "GEA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Ultimately,\nthis survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers\nadvancing context-aware AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u201d\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b66\u79d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67901300\u591a\u7bc7\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u957f\u7bc7\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\uff09\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u957f\u7bc7\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5AI\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate whether the ability of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to explain humour depends on the particular humour\nform. We compare models on simple puns and more complex topical humour that\nrequires knowledge of real-world entities and events. In doing so, we curate a\ndataset of 600 jokes split across 4 joke types and manually write high-quality\nexplanations. These jokes include heterographic and homographic puns,\ncontemporary internet humour, and topical jokes, where understanding relies on\nreasoning beyond \"common sense\", rooted instead in world knowledge regarding\nnews events and pop culture. Using this dataset, we compare the zero-shot\nabilities of a range of LLMs to accurately and comprehensively explain jokes of\ndifferent types, identifying key research gaps in the task of humour\nexplanation. We find that none of the tested models (inc. reasoning models) are\ncapable of reliably generating adequate explanations of all joke types, further\nhighlighting the narrow focus of most works in computational humour on overly\nsimple joke forms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u6240\u6709\u7b11\u8bdd\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7b80\u77ed\u53cc\u5173\u7b11\u8bdd\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b600\u4e2a\u7b11\u8bdd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d64\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u5199\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684LLMs\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5747\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u6240\u6709\u7b11\u8bdd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e7d\u9ed8\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7b11\u8bdd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u5e7d\u9ed8\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
