STELLA employs a\nmulti-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities\nthrough two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning\nstrategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent\nautomatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows\nSTELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring\napproximately 26\\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\\% on LAB-Bench:\nDBQA, and 63\\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6\npercentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance\nsystematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the\nHumanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials.

Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination.

To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the\nhighest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON\nrepresentation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid\nplan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task\n- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade\nperformance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from\nnatural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex\nproblems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will\ninevitably shift.

Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is\noften treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality\nin its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is\ncollected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and\ndomain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects\nshared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful\ndynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be\ntreated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and\ngrounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,\nlower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and\ncomputationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.\nDeveloping models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement\ndata will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and\ncontrol, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across\nbiological and artificial systems.

Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental\nrationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk\nparadigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of\nartificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from\nrigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in\nsystems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk\nmischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective\ngovernance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5\u670d\u4ece\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5df2\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8f6c\u5411\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4ee5\u670d\u4ece\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5df2\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6AI\u884c\u4e3a\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u54f2\u5b66\u8ba8\u8bba\uff08\u5982\u5de5\u5177\u7406\u6027\u3001\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4fee\u8ba2\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u9669\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u7684\u201c\u4e0d\u670d\u4ece\u201d\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5931\u63a7\u6216\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u547c\u5401AI\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u50f5\u5316\u7684\u670d\u4ece\u8f6c\u5411\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f26\u7406\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bef\u5224AI\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u7ef4\u62a4\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6cbb\u7406\u3002"}}

As AI\nagents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have\nintroduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.\nThese benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task\noutcomes via specific reward designs.

For example, SWE-bench\nVerified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses\nas successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'\nperformance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation\nrigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of\nguidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey\nof best practices, and previously reported issues.

To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation.
