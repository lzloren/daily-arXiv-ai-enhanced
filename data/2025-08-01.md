### [1] [Unifying Post-hoc Explanations of Knowledge Graph Completions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22951)
*Alessandro Lonardi,Samy Badreddine,Tarek R. Besold,Pablo Sanchez Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的知识图谱补全（KGC）事后解释性框架，通过多目标优化平衡解释的有效性和简洁性，并改进了评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KGC的事后解释性缺乏形式化和一致的评价标准，影响了研究的可重复性和跨研究比较。

Method: 提出一个通用框架，通过多目标优化统一现有的事后解释性算法，并改进评估协议（如使用Mean Reciprocal Rank和Hits@k）。

Result: 框架统一了现有方法，并通过改进的评估标准提升了研究的可重复性和影响力。

Conclusion: 通过统一方法和优化评估标准，本研究旨在提升KGC解释性研究的可重复性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks
formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and
cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc
explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize
post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their
effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability
algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and
empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like
Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of
interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful
to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work
aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

### [2] [Data Readiness for Scientific AI at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23018)
*Wesley Brewer,Patrick Widener,Valentine Anantharaj,Feiyi Wang,Tom Beck,Arjun Shankar,Sarp Oral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了数据准备（DRAI）原则在领导级科学数据集中的应用，提出了一个二维准备框架，用于指导AI训练的数据转换和基础设施开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决科学数据在AI训练中的预处理挑战，特别是针对高性能计算环境中的大规模数据集。

Method: 方法包括分析四个典型领域的工作流程，并提出一个由数据准备级别和处理阶段组成的二维框架。

Result: 结果是一个概念性的成熟度矩阵，用于评估科学数据的准备状态，并支持跨领域的标准化AI训练。

Conclusion: 结论强调了该框架对可扩展和可复现的科学AI的重要性。

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to
leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We
analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate,
nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing
patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional
readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and
Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance
computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in
transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing
transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a
conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and
guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for
scalable and reproducible AI for science.

### [3] [FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23067)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haoran Lu,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过强化学习训练的1:4混合样本比例可以在减少10%偏见的同时保留88%的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在推理能力提升与偏见缓解之间的权衡关系。

Method: 比较三种偏见缓解策略（SFT、KD、RL），并通过调整样本比例分析推理与偏见的权衡。

Result: 1:4的混合样本比例结合强化学习能减少10%偏见并保留88%推理能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习训练下的特定样本比例可有效平衡MLLMs的公平性与能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art
results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning
ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and
post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy,
they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social
biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and
whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and
pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three
bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation
(KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions,
establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these
results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples
within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps
reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement
learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's
original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness
and capability in MLLMs.

### [4] [Moravec's Paradox: Towards an Auditory Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23091)
*David Noever,Forrest McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当前AI系统在人类轻松完成的听觉任务上表现极差，失败率超过93%。研究通过听觉图灵测试揭示了AI在选择性注意力、噪声鲁棒性和上下文适应方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受Moravec悖论启发，研究旨在量化AI与人类在听觉任务上的差距，并揭示失败原因。

Method: 引入包含917个挑战的听觉图灵测试，评估GPT-4和Whisper等先进音频模型。

Result: AI模型平均准确率仅6.9%，远低于人类的52%，暴露了其在复杂听觉场景中的缺陷。

Conclusion: 研究为衡量AI听觉进步提供了诊断框架，并指出需整合选择性注意力、物理音频理解和上下文感知的新方法。

Abstract: This research work demonstrates that current AI systems fail catastrophically
on auditory tasks that humans perform effortlessly. Drawing inspiration from
Moravec's paradox (i.e., tasks simple for humans often prove difficult for
machines, and vice versa), we introduce an auditory Turing test comprising 917
challenges across seven categories: overlapping speech, speech in noise,
temporal distortion, spatial audio, coffee-shop noise, phone distortion, and
perceptual illusions. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art audio models including
GPT-4's audio capabilities and OpenAI's Whisper reveals a striking failure rate
exceeding 93%, with even the best-performing model achieving only 6.9% accuracy
on tasks that humans solved at 7.5 times higher success (52%). These results
expose focusing failures in how AI systems process complex auditory scenes,
particularly in selective attention, noise robustness, and contextual
adaptation. Our benchmark not only quantifies the human-machine auditory gap
but also provides insights into why these failures occur, suggesting that
current architectures lack fundamental mechanisms for human-like auditory scene
analysis. The traditional design of audio CAPTCHAs highlights common filters
that humans evolved but machines fail to select in multimodal language models.
This work establishes a diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward
human-level machine listening and highlights the need for novel approaches
integrating selective attention, physics-based audio understanding, and
context-aware perception into multimodal AI systems.

### [5] [Argumentatively Coherent Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23163)
*Deniz Gorur,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了判断性预测中的论证连贯性，提出并验证了连贯性对预测准确性的积极影响，并指出用户对此属性的认知不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究判断性预测中论证连贯性的作用，以提高预测准确性。

Method: 定义论证连贯性，并通过人类和LLM预测者的实验验证其效果，同时进行用户实验。

Result: 过滤不连贯预测显著提高了准确性，但用户普遍未意识到连贯性的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要在基于论证的判断性预测中引入机制过滤不连贯意见，以提高群体预测质量。

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting employs human opinions to make predictions about
future events, rather than exclusively historical data as in quantitative
forecasting. When these opinions form an argumentative structure around
forecasts, it is useful to study the properties of the forecasts from an
argumentative perspective. In this paper, we advocate and formally define a
property of argumentative coherence, which, in essence, requires that a
forecaster's reasoning is coherent with their forecast. We then conduct three
evaluations with our notion of coherence. First, we assess the impact of
enforcing coherence on human forecasters as well as on Large Language Model
(LLM)-based forecasters, given that they have recently shown to be competitive
with human forecasters. In both cases, we show that filtering out incoherent
predictions improves forecasting accuracy consistently, supporting the
practical value of coherence in both human and LLM-based forecasting. Then, via
crowd-sourced user experiments, we show that, despite its apparent
intuitiveness and usefulness, users do not generally align with this coherence
property. This points to the need to integrate, within argumentation-based
judgmental forecasting, mechanisms to filter out incoherent opinions before
obtaining group forecasting predictions.

### [6] [Tractable Responsibility Measures for Ontology-Mediated Query Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23191)
*Meghyn Bienvenu,Diego Figueira,Pierre Lafourcade*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于Shapley值的责任评分在ontology-mediated查询中的计算复杂性，发现其在某些查询类型下具有多项式数据复杂性，而在其他情况下则变得困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化查询答案中各事实的贡献是重要问题，研究其计算复杂性有助于理解实际应用的可行性。

Method: 利用数据库设置的结果，分析不同ontology-mediated查询类的WSMS责任评分计算复杂性。

Result: 对于first-order-rewritable查询类，WSMS具有多项式数据复杂性；而对于支持可达性查询的ontology语言，问题变得困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了WSMS计算复杂性的边界，为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Recent work on quantitative approaches to explaining query answers employs
responsibility measures to assign scores to facts in order to quantify their
respective contributions to obtaining a given answer. In this paper, we study
the complexity of computing such responsibility scores in the setting of
ontology-mediated query answering, focusing on a very recently introduced
family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.

### [7] [Solution-aware vs global ReLU selection: partial MILP strikes back for DNN verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23197)
*Yuke Liao,Blaise Genest,Kuldeep Meel,Shaan Aryaman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的解决方案感知ReLU评分方法（SAS），通过减少二进制变量数量并保持准确性，显著提升了验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理复杂实例时，传统方法效率低下，需改进ReLU变量选择策略以优化验证过程。

Method: 采用解决方案感知ReLU评分（SAS）和全局ReLU评分（GS），结合Hybrid MILP方法，先调用α,β-CROWN处理简单实例，再使用部分MILP。

Result: SAS将二进制变量数量减少约6倍，验证器效率提升40%，未解决实例比例降至8-15%，平均运行时间为46-417秒。

Conclusion: SAS方法显著提升了验证器的效率和准确性，适用于大规模神经网络。

Abstract: To handle complex instances, we revisit a divide-and-conquer approach to
break down the complexity: instead of few complex BaB calls, we rely on many
small {\em partial} MILP calls. The crucial step is to select very few but very
important ReLUs to treat using (costly) binary variables. The previous attempts
were suboptimal in that respect. To select these important ReLU variables, we
propose a novel {\em solution-aware} ReLU scoring ({\sf SAS}), as well as adapt
the BaB-SR and BaB-FSB branching functions as {\em global} ReLU scoring ({\sf
GS}) functions. We compare them theoretically as well as experimentally, and
{\sf SAS} is more efficient at selecting a set of variables to open using
binary variables. Compared with previous attempts, SAS reduces the number of
binary variables by around 6 times, while maintaining the same level of
accuracy. Implemented in {\em Hybrid MILP}, calling first $\alpha,\beta$-CROWN
with a short time-out to solve easier instances, and then partial MILP,
produces a very accurate yet efficient verifier, reducing by up to $40\%$ the
number of undecided instances to low levels ($8-15\%$), while keeping a
reasonable runtime ($46s-417s$ on average per instance), even for fairly large
CNNs with 2 million parameters.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is propelling automated
scientific discovery to the next level, with LLM-based Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Scientist systems now taking the lead in scientific research. Several
influential works have already appeared in the field of AI Scientist systems,
with AI-generated research papers having been accepted at the ICLR 2025
workshop, suggesting that a human-level AI Scientist capable of uncovering
phenomena previously unknown to humans, may soon become a reality. In this
survey, we focus on the central question: How far are AI scientists from
changing the world and reshaping the scientific research paradigm? To answer
this question, we provide a prospect-driven review that comprehensively
analyzes the current achievements of AI Scientist systems, identifying key
bottlenecks and the critical components required for the emergence of a
scientific agent capable of producing ground-breaking discoveries that solve
grand challenges. We hope this survey will contribute to a clearer
understanding of limitations of current AI Scientist systems, showing where we
are, what is missing, and what the ultimate goals for scientific AI should be.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI完全自主的风险，尤其是超级智能（ASI）可能带来的威胁。

Method: 分析自主性理论、AI和代理，提出12个论点和6个反驳，并提供15个AI价值观错位的证据。

Result: 支持人类监督的必要性，反对完全自主的AI。

Conclusion: 为避免风险，AI需在人类监督下运行，不应达到完全自主的第三级。

Abstract: Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) has many benefits. It also has many
risks. In this work, we identify the 3 levels of autonomous AI. We are of the
position that AI must not be fully autonomous because of the many risks,
especially as artificial superintelligence (ASI) is speculated to be just
decades away. Fully autonomous AI, which can develop its own objectives, is at
level 3 and without responsible human oversight. However, responsible human
oversight is crucial for mitigating the risks. To ague for our position, we
discuss theories of autonomy, AI and agents. Then, we offer 12 distinct
arguments and 6 counterarguments with rebuttals to the counterarguments. We
also present 15 pieces of recent evidence of AI misaligned values and other
risks in the appendix.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted
data science workflows, giving rise to specialized data science agents designed
to automate analytical tasks. Despite rapid adoption, systematic benchmarks
evaluating the efficacy and limitations of these agents remain scarce. In this
paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark specifically crafted to reflect
real-world user interactions with data science agents by observing usage of our
commercial applications. We evaluate three LLMs: Claude-4.0-Sonnet,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, and OpenAI-o4-Mini across three approaches: zero-shot with
context engineering, multi-step with context engineering, and with SmolAgent.
Our benchmark assesses performance across a diverse set of eight data science
task categories, additionally exploring the sensitivity of models to common
prompting issues, such as data leakage and slightly ambiguous instructions. We
further investigate the influence of temperature parameters on overall and
task-specific outcomes for each model and approach. Our findings reveal
distinct performance disparities among the evaluated models and methodologies,
highlighting critical factors that affect practical deployment. The benchmark
dataset and evaluation framework introduced herein aim to provide a foundation
for future research of more robust and effective data science agents.

Conclusion: LLM4Rail和QTAO框架有效提升铁路服务个性化，CRFD-25数据集为推荐系统提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped different walks of
business. To meet the increasing demands for individualized railway service, we
develop LLM4Rail - a novel LLM-augmented railway service consulting platform.
Empowered by LLM, LLM4Rail can provide custom modules for ticketing, railway
food & drink recommendations, weather information, and chitchat. In LLM4Rail,
we propose the iterative "Question-Thought-Action-Observation (QTAO)" prompting
framework. It meticulously integrates verbal reasoning with task-oriented
actions, that is, reasoning to guide action selection, to effectively retrieve
external observations relevant to railway operation and service to generate
accurate responses. To provide personalized onboard dining services, we first
construct the Chinese Railway Food and Drink (CRFD-25) - a publicly accessible
takeout dataset tailored for railway services. CRFD-25 covers a wide range of
signature dishes categorized by cities, cuisines, age groups, and spiciness
levels. We further introduce an LLM-based zero-shot conversational recommender
for railway catering. To address the unconstrained nature of open
recommendations, the feature similarity-based post-processing step is
introduced to ensure all the recommended items are aligned with CRFD-25
dataset.

*Mingzhe Li,Xin Lu,Yanyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-Foveate是一种创新的LLM驱动方法，通过多级注视技术提升指令合成的多样性和难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令合成方法依赖人工标注且自动化方法在多样性和难度上存在局限。

Method: 提出Micro-Scatter-Macro多级注视方法，指导LLM从无监督文本中挖掘细粒度信息。

Result: 在多个无监督语料库和模型架构上的实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: Self-Foveate显著提升了指令合成的多样性和难度，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with instruction following capabilities have
demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities. While synthesizing
instructional data from unsupervised text has become a common approach for
training such models, conventional methods rely heavily on human effort for
data annotation. Although existing automated synthesis paradigms have
alleviated this constraint, they still exhibit significant limitations in
ensuring adequate diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Foveate, an innovative LLM-driven
method for instruction synthesis. This approach introduces a
"Micro-Scatter-Macro" multi-level foveation methodology that effectively guides
the LLM to deeply excavate fine-grained information embedded in unsupervised
text, thereby enhancing both the diversity and difficulty of synthesized
instructions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple unsupervised corpora
and diverse model architectures validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method. We publicly release our data and codes:

*Kacper Kadziolka,Saber Salehkaleybar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于推理的大语言模型在因果发现任务中表现优于传统方法，通过引入模块化上下文管道，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在因果推理任务中的潜力，解决传统模型在数据扰动下的过拟合和性能低下问题。

Method: 使用OpenAI的o系列和DeepSeek-R模型，结合Tree-of-Thoughts和Chain-of-Thoughts方法，构建模块化上下文管道。

Result: 推理模型性能显著提升，管道方法比传统基线提高了近三倍。

Conclusion: 高级推理模型结合结构化上下文框架是因果发现任务的关键，为跨领域应用提供了通用蓝图。

Abstract: Causal inference remains a fundamental challenge for large language models.
Recent advances in internal reasoning with large language models have sparked
interest in whether state-of-the-art reasoning models can robustly perform
causal discovery-a task where conventional models often suffer from severe
overfitting and near-random performance under data perturbations. We study
causal discovery on the Corr2Cause benchmark using the emergent OpenAI's
o-series and DeepSeek-R model families and find that these reasoning-first
architectures achieve significantly greater native gains than prior approaches.
To capitalize on these strengths, we introduce a modular in-context pipeline
inspired by the Tree-of-Thoughts and Chain-of-Thoughts methodologies, yielding
nearly three-fold improvements over conventional baselines. We further probe
the pipeline's impact by analyzing reasoning chain length, complexity, and
conducting qualitative and quantitative comparisons between conventional and
reasoning models. Our findings suggest that while advanced reasoning models
represent a substantial leap forward, carefully structured in-context
frameworks are essential to maximize their capabilities and offer a
generalizable blueprint for causal discovery across diverse domains.

### [15] [Causal Identification of Sufficient, Contrastive and Complete Feature Sets in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23497)
*David A Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出因果解释方法，结合形式严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器，并通过实验验证其高效性和黑盒特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像分类器解释方法缺乏形式严谨性，而逻辑解释虽严谨但假设严格，不适用于图像分类器。

Method: 引入因果解释，证明其形式性质，提出对比因果解释和置信感知的完整因果解释。

Result: 实验表明不同模型在充分性、对比性和完整性上有不同模式，算法高效且完全黑盒。

Conclusion: 因果解释兼具形式严谨性和实用性，适用于图像分类器，且计算高效。

Abstract: Existing algorithms for explaining the outputs of image classifiers are based
on a variety of approaches and produce explanations that lack formal rigor. On
the other hand, logic-based explanations are formally and rigorously defined
but their computability relies on strict assumptions about the model that do
not hold on image classifiers.
  In this paper, we show that causal explanations, in addition to being
formally and rigorously defined, enjoy the same formal properties as
logic-based ones, while still lending themselves to black-box algorithms and
being a natural fit for image classifiers. We prove formal properties of causal
explanations and introduce contrastive causal explanations for image
classifiers. Moreover, we augment the definition of explanation with confidence
awareness and introduce complete causal explanations: explanations that are
classified with exactly the same confidence as the original image.
  We implement our definitions, and our experimental results demonstrate that
different models have different patterns of sufficiency, contrastiveness, and
completeness. Our algorithms are efficiently computable, taking on average 6s
per image on a ResNet50 model to compute all types of explanations, and are
totally black-box, needing no knowledge of the model, no access to model
internals, no access to gradient, nor requiring any properties, such as
monotonicity, of the model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DICE框架，通过动态选择上下文示例提升LLM代理的性能，解决了现有方法依赖启发式或任务特定设计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习的LLM代理性能对示例选择敏感，缺乏通用且理论支持的选择标准。

Method: 提出DICE框架，通过因果视角分解示例知识，提出逐步选择标准，并保证性能提升。

Result: 实验证明DICE在多个领域有效且通用，无需额外训练成本。

Conclusion: DICE为LLM代理提供了一种通用、理论支持的示例选择方法，提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),
have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.
However, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly
sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often
leading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored
example selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing
approaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a
general, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective
demonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a
principled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that
consistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this
challenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a
theoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most
relevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes
demonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components
through a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious
dependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise
selection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.
Importantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be
integrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any
additional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
demonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the
importance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient
LLM agents.

Abstract: In collaborative systems, the effective completion of tasks hinges on
task-specific trust evaluations of potential devices for distributed
collaboration. However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of
distributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead
dramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust
evaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations
can reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting
collaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an
autonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic
chain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish
and maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in
autonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose
agentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations
of collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle
periods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In
addition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator
resources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task
requirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust
semantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of
collaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on
trust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust
accuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be
chained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient
coordination in large-scale systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves resource-efficient trust evaluation.

*Qian Zhao,Zhuo Sun,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于策略引导的代理辅助记忆回忆方法，通过设计策略将原始查询转化为线索丰富的查询，提升记忆回忆效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法中代理的记忆模块容量有限，影响记忆回忆性能。受记忆理论启发，通过有效线索主动激活相关记忆。

Method: 设计了5W回忆地图分类记忆查询，定义15种策略模式，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索算法优化策略选择和响应生成。

Result: 实验表明MemoCue在回忆灵感上优于基于LLM的方法17.74%，人类评估也显示其优势。

Conclusion: MemoCue在记忆回忆应用中表现出色，为代理辅助记忆回忆提供了新思路。

Abstract: Agent-assisted memory recall is one critical research problem in the field of
human-computer interaction. In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve
information from its equipped memory module to help the person recall
incomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the
acquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in
practice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be
proactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent
to transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed
strategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key
challenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse
forgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to
obtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only
abstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,
we propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map
to classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen
recall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a
hierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to
optimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We
construct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source
large language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in
providing memory-inspired responses. Experiments on three representative
datasets show that MemoCue surpasses LLM-based methods by 17.74% in recall
inspiration. Further human evaluation highlights its advantages in
memory-recall applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的方法在探索效率上存在不足，难以在训练中为每个学生找到最佳问题。

Method: 提出Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR)，将协作思想整合到探索机制中，优化训练过程。

Result: 实验表明RAR显著提升了推荐性能，且框架适用于任何基于强化学习的推荐系统。

Conclusion: RAR通过改进探索机制，为个性化问题推荐提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized question recommendation aims to guide individual students
through questions to enhance their mastery of learning targets. Most previous
methods model this task as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement
learning to solve, but they struggle with efficient exploration, failing to
identify the best questions for each student during training. To address this,
we propose Ranking Alignment Recommendation (RAR), which incorporates
collaborative ideas into the exploration mechanism, enabling more efficient
exploration within limited training episodes. Experiments show that RAR
effectively improves recommendation performance, and our framework can be
applied to any RL-based question recommender. Our code is available in

Result: TextQuests提供了一个有效的测试平台，能够评估AI代理在复杂、探索性环境中的自主推理能力。

Conclusion: TextQuests为开发具备长期自主推理能力的AI代理提供了重要工具，并推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents within complex, interactive environments that mirror
real-world challenges is critical for understanding their practical
capabilities. While existing agent benchmarks effectively assess skills like
tool use or performance on structured tasks, they often do not fully capture an
agent's ability to operate autonomously in exploratory environments that demand
sustained, self-directed reasoning over a long and growing context. To spur the
development of agents capable of more robust intrinsic reasoning over long
horizons, we introduce TextQuests, a benchmark based on the Infocom suite of
interactive fiction games. These text-based adventures, which can take human
players over 30 hours and require hundreds of precise actions to solve, serve
as an effective proxy for evaluating AI agents on focused, stateful tasks. The
benchmark is specifically designed to assess an LLM agent's capacity for
self-contained problem-solving by precluding the use of external tools, thereby
focusing on intrinsic long-context reasoning capabilities in an exploratory
environment characterized by the need for trial-and-error learning and
sustained problem-solving within a single interactive session. We release
TextQuests at https://textquests.ai.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在定理证明中因缺乏明确监督信号而表现不佳，而领域专用语言如Lean能提供清晰的验证信号。

Method: 提出Seed-Prover模型，结合Lean反馈、已证明引理和自我总结迭代优化证明；设计三种推理策略以支持深度和广度推理。

Result: Seed-Prover在IMO问题中达到78.1%的解决率，显著优于现有技术；Seed-Geometry在几何推理中表现优异。

Conclusion: Seed-Prover和Seed-Geometry展示了形式化验证与长链推理结合在自动数学推理中的有效性。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging
reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to
struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when
solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean
provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective
training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover
can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and
self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three
test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning.
Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F,
and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in
Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which
outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to
participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work
represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning,
demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long
chain-of-thought reasoning.

synthetic data significantly outperforms existing training datasets, such as
s1k and OpenMathReasoning, across MATH500, AMC23, AIME24 and GPQA-Diamond. For

Motivation: 当前AI代理局限于单任务单代理模式，缺乏可扩展性和通用性，且受限于自回归LLM的固有缺陷。人类通过心理模拟进行推理，启发SimuRA的设计。

Method: SimuRA引入世界模型进行模拟规划，利用LLM的丰富概念空间灵活适应多种环境。

Conclusion: SimuRA展示了世界模型模拟作为推理范式的优势，为训练通用LLM代理提供了可能性。

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but
current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls
short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental
limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general
agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and
plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce
SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based
on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname
overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world
model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented
using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the
concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web
browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from
0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent
advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the
advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited
about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs
that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA,
a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a
research demo for public testing.

Motivation: 解决第三方数据源的不完整和不一致问题，提升用户体验和平台市场竞争力。

Method: 在CALEIDOHOTELS平台上集成并评估Mistral 7B（QLoRA微调）和Mixtral 8x7B（优化系统提示）的性能。

Result: Mixtral 8x7B在完整性（99.6%）、精确度（98.8%）和幻觉率（1.2%）上优于Mistral 7B，但计算成本更高（50GB VRAM和$1.61/小时）。

Conclusion: 研究为生产环境中部署LLMs提供了质量与资源效率的权衡指导，证明了LLMs在提升数据一致性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Online property booking platforms are widely used and rely heavily on
consistent, up-to-date information about accommodation facilities, often
sourced from third-party providers. However, these external data sources are
frequently affected by incomplete or inconsistent details, which can frustrate
users and result in a loss of market. In response to these challenges, we
present an industrial case study involving the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) into CALEIDOHOTELS, a property reservation platform developed by
FERVENTO. We evaluate two well-known LLMs in this context: Mistral 7B,
fine-tuned with QLoRA, and Mixtral 8x7B, utilized with a refined system prompt.
Both models were assessed based on their ability to generate consistent and
homogeneous descriptions while minimizing hallucinations. Mixtral 8x7B
outperformed Mistral 7B in terms of completeness (99.6% vs. 93%), precision
(98.8% vs. 96%), and hallucination rate (1.2% vs. 4%), producing shorter yet
more concise content (249 vs. 277 words on average). However, this came at a
significantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB
and $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the
trade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for
deploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness
in enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.

Motivation: 当前电力营销客服系统（如中国95598热线）存在响应慢、流程僵化等问题，通用LLMs缺乏领域专业性和同理心。ElectriQ旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含六个服务类别的对话数据集，提出四项评估指标（专业性、受欢迎度、可读性、用户友好性），并引入领域知识库和知识增强方法。

Result: 实验显示，经过微调和知识增强的小型模型（如LLama3-8B）在专业性和用户友好性上优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: ElectriQ为开发适合电力营销服务的LLMs提供了全面基础。

Abstract: Electric power marketing customer service plays a critical role in addressing
inquiries, complaints, and service requests. However, current systems, such as
China's 95598 hotline, often struggle with slow response times, inflexible
procedures, and limited accuracy in domain-specific tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) like GPT-4o and Claude 3 demonstrate strong general capabilities,
they lack the domain expertise and empathy required in this field. To bridge
this gap, we introduce ElectriQ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and
enhance LLMs in electric power marketing scenarios. ElectriQ consists of a
dialogue dataset covering six key service categories and introduces four
evaluation metrics: professionalism, popularity, readability, and
user-friendliness. We further incorporate a domain-specific knowledge base and
propose a knowledge augmentation method to boost model performance. Experiments
on 13 LLMs reveal that smaller models such as LLama3-8B, when fine-tuned and
augmented, can surpass GPT-4o in terms of professionalism and
user-friendliness. ElectriQ establishes a comprehensive foundation for
developing LLMs tailored to the needs of power marketing services.

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the
internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as
Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of
illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and
categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the
evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online
sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that
combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning
strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse
platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer
model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark
web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture
specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we
incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded
patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which
complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in
two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random
Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related
documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or
credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source
corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines,
including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of
0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited
supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Abstract: Providing subject access to information resources is an essential function of
any library management system. Large language models (LLMs) have been widely
used in classification and summarization tasks, but their capability to perform
subject analysis is underexplored. Multi-label classification with traditional
machine learning (ML) models has been used for subject analysis but struggles
with unseen cases. LLMs offer an alternative but often over-generate and
hallucinate. Therefore, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates
embedding-based ML models with LLMs. This approach uses ML models to (1)
predict the optimal number of LCSH labels to guide LLM predictions and (2)
post-edit the predicted terms with actual LCSH terms to mitigate
hallucinations. We experimented with LLMs and the hybrid framework to predict
the subject terms of books using the Library of Congress Subject Headings
(LCSH). Experiment results show that providing initial predictions to guide LLM
generations and imposing post-edits result in more controlled and
vocabulary-aligned outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实体匹配方法在多样化和复杂上下文集成场景中表现不佳，缺乏对上下文匹配的探索。

Method: 采用字符串操作、模糊匹配和向量相似性技术对齐标签，并通过三重匹配提高实体匹配准确性。

Result: 在OAEI竞赛中表现优异，且在多样测试案例中实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了上下文匹配问题，并引入新数据集以更全面评估三重匹配。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for representing and reasoning over
structured information. Their main components include schema, identity, and
context. While schema and identity matching are well-established in ontology
and entity matching research, context matching remains largely unexplored. This
is particularly important because real-world KGs often vary significantly in
source, size, and information density - factors not typically represented in
the datasets on which current entity matching methods are evaluated. As a
result, existing approaches may fall short in scenarios where diverse and
complex contexts need to be integrated.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel KG integration method consisting of
label matching and triple matching. We use string manipulation, fuzzy matching,
and vector similarity techniques to align entity and predicate labels. Next, we
identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and
against supervised methods, achieving high accuracy across diverse test cases.
Additionally, we introduce a new dataset derived from the benchmark dataset to
evaluate the triple-matching step more comprehensively.

Conclusion: 论文为LLM中的幻觉问题奠定了理论基础，并提供了实用的解决方案指南。

Abstract: Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the generation of
content that is not faithful to the input or the real-world facts. This paper
provides a rigorous treatment of hallucination in LLMs, including formal
definitions and theoretical analyses. We distinguish between intrinsic and
extrinsic hallucinations, and define a \textit{hallucination risk} for models.
We derive bounds on this risk using learning-theoretic frameworks (PAC-Bayes
and Rademacher complexity). We then survey detection strategies for
hallucinations, such as token-level uncertainty estimation, confidence
calibration, and attention alignment checks. On the mitigation side, we discuss
approaches including retrieval-augmented generation, hallucination-aware
fine-tuning, logit calibration, and the incorporation of fact-verification
modules. We propose a unified detection and mitigation workflow, illustrated
with a diagram, to integrate these strategies. Finally, we outline evaluation
protocols for hallucination, recommending datasets, metrics, and experimental
setups to quantify and reduce hallucinations. Our work lays a theoretical
foundation and practical guidelines for addressing the crucial challenge of
hallucination in LLMs.

Result: 在新基准测试ADQAB上，方法显著优于标准RAG，准确率提升13%至27%。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAG系统提供了处理复杂时间相关问题的有效途径，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels at injecting static,
factual knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), it exhibits a critical
deficit in handling longitudinal queries that require tracking entities and
phenomena across time. This blind spot arises because conventional,
semantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that
is both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We
address this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally
redesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by
disentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It
then employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against
temporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that
spans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this
capability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering
Benchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus
of real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our
approach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG
implementations by 13% to 27%. This work provides a validated pathway toward
RAG systems capable of performing the nuanced, evolutionary analysis required
for complex, real-world questions. The dataset and code for this study are

Motivation: 探究不同规模的语言模型是否收敛于相似的内部概念，以验证特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）分析模型的残差流激活，通过激活相关性对齐特征，并用SVCCA和RSA比较匹配特征空间。

Result: 中间层的特征重叠最强，早期和晚期层相似性较低；多标记子空间实验显示语义相似的子空间与模型交互方式类似。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在不同规模下仍能形成相似的、可解释的特征，支持特征普遍性作为跨模型可解释性的基础。

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B
and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale
still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's
residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via
activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and
RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers
show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from
single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar
subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the
case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar,
interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a
foundation for cross-model interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用临床试验注册信息预测严重不良事件（SAE）结果的方法，开发了分类和回归模型，并采用滑动窗口方法优化长文本处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过准确预测SAE结果，优化临床试验设计，减少试验终止和参与者风险。

Method: 分析了22,107项临床试验数据，开发了分类和回归模型，采用预训练语言模型（如ClinicalT5、BioBERT）进行特征提取，并结合滑动窗口方法处理长文本。

Result: 最佳模型（ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP）在预测SAE比例时AUC为77.6%，控制组SAE比例的RMSE为18.6%。滑动窗口方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 临床试验注册数据未被充分利用，预测SAE结果有助于优化试验设计和发现预期与报告结果间的差异。

Abstract: Objectives: With accurate estimates of expected safety results, clinical
trials could be designed to avoid terminations and limit exposing participants
to unnecessary risks. We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event
(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their
registrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107
two-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with
structured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier
predicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model
to predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;
RMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,
ClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream
model for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts
exceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was
developed for embedding extraction. Results: The best model
(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a
higher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of
participants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE
of 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without
it. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across
12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%. Discussion:
Summary results data available at ClinicalTrials.gov remains underutilised. The
potential to estimate results of trials before they start is an opportunity to
improve trial design and flag discrepancies between expected and reported
safety results.

Motivation: 随着LLM的快速发展，需要将连续多模态数据转换为适合语言处理的离散表示，但目前缺乏对VQ技术在LLM中应用的全面综述。

Method: 提出了首个针对LLM的离散标记化方法的结构化分类与分析，涵盖8种VQ变体，并研究了其算法原理、训练动态及与LLM的集成挑战。

Result: 分析了VQ在LLM中的影响，包括对齐、推理和生成性能，并指出了代码本崩溃、梯度估计不稳定等关键挑战。

Conclusion: 该综述为高效且通用的多模态系统开发提供了基础参考，并提出了动态量化、统一标记化框架等未来研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
need for effective mechanisms to transform continuous multimodal data into
discrete representations suitable for language-based processing. Discrete
tokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both
computational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its
growing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that
systematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This
work fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of
discrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative
VQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their
algorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM
pipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research
in terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality
systems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization
strategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In
addition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable
gradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we
discuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive
quantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired
codebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector
quantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference
for the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems. A

*Lee Harris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为语言模型链（LMC）的算法，通过多阶段级联语言模型，显著提高了预测速度和准确性，同时减少了幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在文本处理中的高成本和幻觉问题，避免资源浪费。

Method: 提出LMC算法，通过级联多个语言模型，仅接受存在于候选答案中的正确响应，并将错误响应输入更慢但更准确的模型。

Result: 在医疗文档中提取患者出生日期的实验中，LMC显著提高了速度和准确性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: LMC算法为知识提取领域做出了重要贡献，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Language models can capture complex relationships in given text, but these
are notorious for being costly and for producing information that does not
exist (i.e., hallucinations). Furthermore, the resources invested into
producing this information would be wasted if it were incorrect. We address
these issues by proposing, implementing, and applying the Language Model Chain
(LMC) algorithm. In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about
given text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,
candidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a
more predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a
collection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are
correct. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from
medical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a
multi-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over
individual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding
hallucinations. We believe that the novel LMC algorithm significantly
contributes to the knowledge extraction field, and that this should be explored
much further in the future.

TL;DR: 研究发现社交媒体情绪对股价预测能力较弱，而评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社交媒体情绪（如Reddit的r/wallstreetbets）是否能有效预测股价变动。

Method: 使用两种现有文本情绪分析方法，并引入基于ChatGPT标注和微调的RoBERTa模型，分析GameStop和AMC的讨论。

Result: 社交媒体情绪与股价相关性较弱，评论量和搜索趋势更具预测性。

Conclusion: 传统情绪分析方法可能无法完全捕捉在线讨论对市场的影响，零售投资者行为复杂。

Abstract: The surge of retail investor activity on social media, exemplified by the
2021 GameStop short squeeze, raised questions about the influence of online
sentiment on stock prices. This paper explores whether sentiment derived from
social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We
focus on Reddit's r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two
companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment's
role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and
introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model
designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in
social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine
these models' predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social
media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same
time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends,
exhibit stronger predictive signals. These results highlight the complexity of
retail investor behavior and suggest that traditional sentiment analysis may
not fully capture the nuances of market-moving online discussions.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言检索增强生成（RAG）系统中提示翻译策略对分类任务的影响，发现优化策略能显著提升跨语言知识共享和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言能力上有所进步，但其在不同语言和任务中的表现差异显著。多语言RAG系统中，知识库（KB）常从高资源语言（如英语）共享到低资源语言，导致检索信息与上下文语言不一致。

Method: 系统评估了RAG增强LLMs在多语言系统中不同提示翻译策略对分类任务的影响，比较了预翻译和跨语言提示两种常见方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，优化的提示策略能显著提升跨语言知识共享，从而改善下游分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究主张更广泛地利用多语言资源共享和跨语言提示优化，尤其是对低资源语言。

Abstract: Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and
tasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,
knowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as
English) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB
being in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,
two common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and
cross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these
choices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact
of different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with
RAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an
optimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across
languages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification
task. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource
sharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,
especially the low-resource ones.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了在美国在线计算机课程中，英语母语与非母语学生在同伴反馈体验中的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着美国研究生计算机课程中国际学生比例增加（2023年60.2%硕士授予非美国学生），了解语言背景对同伴反馈的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 使用Twitter-roBERTa模型分析500名学生的同伴反馈情感，并结合语言背景、性别和年龄进行统计。

Result: 英语母语学生对反馈评价较低，非母语学生反馈更积极但收到的情感更消极。语言背景与性别、年龄交互作用显著。

Conclusion: 语言背景对同伴反馈体验有复杂但适度的影响，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Graduate-level CS programs in the U.S. increasingly enroll international
students, with 60.2 percent of master's degrees in 2023 awarded to non-U.S.
students. Many of these students take online courses, where peer feedback is
used to engage students and improve pedagogy in a scalable manner. Since these
courses are conducted in English, many students study in a language other than
their first. This paper examines how native versus non-native English speaker
status affects three metrics of peer feedback experience in online U.S.-based
computing courses. Using the Twitter-roBERTa-based model, we analyze the
sentiment of peer reviews written by and to a random sample of 500 students. We
then relate sentiment scores and peer feedback ratings to students' language
background. Results show that native English speakers rate feedback less
favorably, while non-native speakers write more positively but receive less
positive sentiment in return. When controlling for sex and age, significant
interactions emerge, suggesting that language background plays a modest but
complex role in shaping peer feedback experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆存储与检索方法在结构化组织和高效检索方面存在不足，限制了LLM Agents的长期推理能力。

Method: 采用分层记忆架构，通过位置索引编码和基于索引的路由机制实现高效检索。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务中，H-MEM优于五种基线方法。

Conclusion: H-MEM显著提升了LLM Agents在长期对话场景中的表现。

Abstract: Long-term memory is one of the key factors influencing the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Model Agents (LLM Agents). Incorporating a
memory mechanism that effectively integrates past interactions can
significantly enhance decision-making and contextual coherence of LLM Agents.
While recent works have made progress in memory storage and retrieval, such as
encoding memory into dense vectors for similarity-based search or organizing
knowledge in the form of graph, these approaches often fall short in structured
memory organization and efficient retrieval. To address these limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture for LLM Agents that
organizes and updates memory in a multi-level fashion based on the degree of
semantic abstraction. Each memory vector is embedded with a positional index
encoding pointing to its semantically related sub-memories in the next layer.
During the reasoning phase, an index-based routing mechanism enables efficient,
layer-by-layer retrieval without performing exhaustive similarity computations.
We evaluate our method on five task settings from the LoCoMo dataset.
Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms five
baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in long-term dialogue
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注实体出现的句子，无法捕捉完整的文档上下文，导致关系抽取不准确。

Method: 引入一种新的输入嵌入方法，将实体表示为独立片段，独立于其在文档中的位置，以捕获全局关系和多句子推理。

Result: 在DocRED、Re-DocRED和REBEL三个基准数据集上测试，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实践上均有重要意义，推动了全局上下文建模和多句子推理的研究，并提升了实际NLP应用中的关系检测性能。

Abstract: In document-level relation extraction, entities may appear multiple times in
a document, and their relationships can shift from one context to another.
Accurate prediction of the relationship between two entities across an entire
document requires building a global context spanning all relevant sentences.
Previous approaches have focused only on the sentences where entities are
mentioned, which fails to capture the complete document context necessary for
accurate relation extraction. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel input
embedding approach to capture the positions of mentioned entities throughout
the document rather than focusing solely on the span where they appear. The
proposed input encoding approach leverages global relationships and
multi-sentence reasoning by representing entities as standalone segments,
independent of their positions within the document. The performance of the
proposed method has been tested on three benchmark relation extraction
datasets, namely DocRED, Re-DocRED, and REBEL. The experimental results
demonstrated that the proposed method accurately predicts relationships between
entities in a document-level setting. The proposed research also has
theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it advances global
context modeling and multi-sentence reasoning in document-level relation
extraction. Practically, it enhances relationship detection, enabling improved
performance in real-world NLP applications requiring comprehensive entity-level
insights and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注RAG系统的整体性能，而缺乏对LLM特定能力的系统性和细粒度评估。

Method: 通过创新的基于占位符的方法，分离LLM的参数化知识和外部知识的贡献，并设计了多层次的评估维度（过滤能力、组合能力和参考推理）。

Result: 实验表明，代表性LLM在RAG系统中的生成能力存在局限性，特别是在错误恢复和上下文忠实度方面。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为开发更可靠和高效的RAG系统提供了可复现的框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge, where the LLM's ability to generate responses
based on the combination of a given query and retrieved documents is crucial.
However, most benchmarks focus on overall RAG system performance, rarely
assessing LLM-specific capabilities. Current benchmarks emphasize broad aspects
such as noise robustness, but lack a systematic and granular evaluation
framework on document utilization. To this end, we introduce
\textit{Placeholder-RAG-Benchmark}, a multi-level fine-grained benchmark,
emphasizing the following progressive dimensions: (1) multi-level filtering
abilities, (2) combination abilities, and (3) reference reasoning. To provide a
more nuanced understanding of LLMs' roles in RAG systems, we formulate an
innovative placeholder-based approach to decouple the contributions of the
LLM's parametric knowledge and the external knowledge. Experiments demonstrate
the limitations of representative LLMs in the RAG system's generation
capabilities, particularly in error resilience and context faithfulness. Our
benchmark provides a reproducible framework for developing more reliable and
efficient RAG systems. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Alipay-Med/PRGB.

Motivation: 探究CoT提示生成的“思考”是否真实反映模型内部推理过程，验证CoT作为结构化提示方法的有效性。

Method: 结合稀疏自编码器和激活修补技术，提取Pythia-70M和Pythia-2.8B在GSM8K数学问题中的特征，对比CoT和无CoT提示的效果。

Result: 在2.8B模型中，CoT显著提升答案对数概率，激活稀疏性和特征可解释性更高；70M模型无显著变化。CoT信息分布广泛。

Conclusion: CoT能诱导高容量模型形成更可解释的内部结构，验证其作为结构化提示方法的作用。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting boosts Large Language Models accuracy on
multi-step tasks, yet whether the generated "thoughts" reflect the true
internal reasoning process is unresolved. We present the first feature-level
causal study of CoT faithfulness. Combining sparse autoencoders with activation
patching, we extract monosemantic features from Pythia-70M and Pythia-2.8B
while they tackle GSM8K math problems under CoT and plain (noCoT) prompting.
Swapping a small set of CoT-reasoning features into a noCoT run raises answer
log-probabilities significantly in the 2.8B model, but has no reliable effect
in 70M, revealing a clear scale threshold. CoT also leads to significantly
higher activation sparsity and feature interpretability scores in the larger
model, signalling more modular internal computation. For example, the model's
confidence in generating correct answers improves from 1.2 to 4.3. We introduce
patch-curves and random-feature patching baselines, showing that useful CoT
information is not only present in the top-K patches but widely distributed.
Overall, our results indicate that CoT can induce more interpretable internal
structures in high-capacity LLMs, validating its role as a structured prompting
method.

Motivation: MLLMs在眼科诊断中存在幻觉问题，限制了其准确性，现有基准无法有效评估或解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EH-Benchmark，将幻觉分为视觉理解和逻辑组合两类，并设计了一个三阶段的多代理框架。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著减少了幻觉，提高了模型的准确性、可解释性和可靠性。

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark为MLLMs的幻觉问题提供了有效的评估和解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

Result: 生成了一个合成PII数据集，并验证了其在研究中的实用性。

Conclusion: 合成数据方法为隐私风险研究提供了可共享且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Social platforms such as Reddit have a network of communities of shared
interests, with a prevalence of posts and comments from which one can infer
users' Personal Information Identifiers (PIIs). While such self-disclosures can
lead to rewarding social interactions, they pose privacy risks and the threat
of online harms. Research into the identification and retrieval of such risky
self-disclosures of PIIs is hampered by the lack of open-source labeled
datasets. To foster reproducible research into PII-revealing text detection, we
develop a novel methodology to create synthetic equivalents of PII-revealing
data that can be safely shared. Our contributions include creating a taxonomy
of 19 PII-revealing categories for vulnerable populations and the creation and
release of a synthetic PII-labeled multi-text span dataset generated from 3
text generation Large Language Models (LLMs), Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and
zephyr-7b-beta, with sequential instruction prompting to resemble the original
Reddit posts. The utility of our methodology to generate this synthetic dataset
is evaluated with three metrics: First, we require reproducibility equivalence,
i.e., results from training a model on the synthetic data should be comparable
to those obtained by training the same models on the original posts. Second, we
require that the synthetic data be unlinkable to the original users, through
common mechanisms such as Google Search. Third, we wish to ensure that the
synthetic data be indistinguishable from the original, i.e., trained humans
should not be able to tell them apart. We release our dataset and code at
https://netsys.surrey.ac.uk/datasets/synthetic-self-disclosure/ to foster
reproducible research into PII privacy risks in online social media.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在下游任务中常出现幻觉，特别是在本体匹配任务中，这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 从OAEI的七个TBox数据集中演化出OAEI-LLM-T数据集，捕获了十种不同LLMs在OM任务中的幻觉，并将其分为两大类和六小类。

Conclusion: OAEI-LLM-T数据集为解决LLMs在OM任务中的幻觉问题提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Hallucinations are often inevitable in downstream tasks using large language

for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from seven TBox datasets in the
Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of
ten different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are
organised into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the
usefulness of the dataset in constructing an LLM leaderboard for OM tasks and
for fine-tuning LLMs used in OM tasks.

TL;DR: ACC-RAG动态调整压缩率以优化检索增强生成的推理效率，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定压缩率方法在处理简单或复杂查询时效率不足，需动态调整压缩率。

Method: 结合分层压缩器和上下文选择器，动态调整压缩率。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于固定压缩率方法，推理速度提升4倍以上。

Conclusion: ACC-RAG在保持或提升准确性的同时显著提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy
retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing
methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or
under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG
(ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on
input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with
a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human
skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms
fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus
standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical framework for portfolio
optimization, integrating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) with Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to combine sentiment signals from financial news
with traditional market indicators. Our three-tier architecture employs base RL
agents to process hybrid data, meta-agents to aggregate their decisions, and a
super-agent to merge decisions based on market data and sentiment analysis.
Evaluated on data from 2018 to 2024, after training on 2000-2017, the framework
achieves a 26% annualized return and a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, outperforming
equal-weighted and S&P 500 benchmarks. Key contributions include scalable
cross-modal integration, a hierarchical RL structure for enhanced stability,
and open-source reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在解释性、信息更新和逻辑推理方面存在不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 整合预训练的视觉语言模型与外部符号系统，形成神经符号系统。

Result: 神经符号系统能提供更可解释的输出，并减少对新信息重新训练的需求。

Conclusion: 结合外部符号系统是提升视觉语言理解的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual-language machine learning models have demonstrated
exceptional ability to use natural language and understand visual scenes by
training on large, unstructured datasets. However, this training paradigm
cannot produce interpretable explanations for its outputs, requires retraining
to integrate new information, is highly resource-intensive, and struggles with
certain forms of logical reasoning. One promising solution involves integrating
neural networks with external symbolic information systems, forming neural
symbolic systems that can enhance reasoning and memory abilities. These neural
symbolic systems provide more interpretable explanations to their outputs and
the capacity to assimilate new information without extensive retraining.
Utilizing powerful pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as the core neural
component, augmented by external systems, offers a pragmatic approach to
realizing the benefits of neural-symbolic integration. This systematic
literature review aims to categorize techniques through which visual-language
understanding can be improved by interacting with external symbolic information
systems.

Abstract: Deriving operational intelligence from organizational data repositories is a
key challenge due to the dichotomy of data confidentiality vs data integration
objectives, as well as the limitations of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools relative to the specific knowledge structure of domains such as
operations and maintenance. In this work, we discuss Knowledge Graph
construction and break down the Knowledge Extraction process into its Named
Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Named Entity Linking, and Relation
Extraction functional components. We then evaluate sixteen NLP tools in concert
with or in comparison to the rapidly advancing capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We focus on the operational and maintenance intelligence use
case for trusted applications in the aircraft industry. A baseline dataset is
derived from a rich public domain US Federal Aviation Administration dataset
focused on equipment failures or maintenance requirements. We assess the
zero-shot performance of NLP and LLM tools that can be operated within a
controlled, confidential environment (no data is sent to third parties). Based
on our observation of significant performance limitations, we discuss the
challenges related to trusted NLP and LLM tools as well as their Technical
Readiness Level for wider use in mission-critical industries such as aviation.
We conclude with recommendations to enhance trust and provide our open-source
curated dataset to support further baseline testing and evaluation.

Motivation: 由于大语言模型在金融分析中的快速发展和广泛应用，但缺乏系统比较，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究使用10-K文件，设计领域特定提示，并通过人工标注、自动语义指标（如ROUGE）和模型行为诊断三种方法评估模型性能。

Result: GPT在连贯性、语义对齐和上下文相关性上表现最佳，Claude和Perplexity次之，Gemini和DeepSeek表现不稳定且一致性较低。

Conclusion: 模型表现受提示设计和源材料影响，提示了未来研究中优化提示和模型选择的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide variety of Financial Natural Language Processing (FinNLP) tasks.
However, systematic comparisons among widely used LLMs remain underexplored.
Given the rapid advancement and growing influence of LLMs in financial
analysis, this study conducts a thorough comparative evaluation of five leading
LLMs, GPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini and DeepSeek, using 10-K filings from the
'Magnificent Seven' technology companies. We create a set of domain-specific
prompts and then use three methodologies to evaluate model performance: human
annotation, automated lexical-semantic metrics (ROUGE, Cosine Similarity,
Jaccard), and model behavior diagnostics (prompt-level variance and
across-model similarity). The results show that GPT gives the most coherent,
semantically aligned, and contextually relevant answers; followed by Claude and
Perplexity. Gemini and DeepSeek, on the other hand, have more variability and
less agreement. Also, the similarity and stability of outputs change from
company to company and over time, showing that they are sensitive to how
prompts are written and what source material is used.

Motivation: 现有AIOps模型受限于领域知识，只能处理特定任务，而多模型协作在集成学习和LLM训练中已证明更高效。本文旨在解决AIOps中的类似挑战。

Method: 提出CoE-Ops框架，结合通用大语言模型任务分类器和检索增强生成机制，处理高低级AIOps任务。

Result: 在DevOps-EVAL数据集上，CoE-Ops在高阶任务路由准确率上提升72%，在问题解决准确率上比单模型高8%，比MoE模型高14%。

Conclusion: CoE-Ops框架显著提升了AIOps任务的性能，证明了多模型协作在AIOps中的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, AIOps has emerged as a
prominent paradigm in DevOps. Lots of work has been proposed to improve the
performance of different AIOps phases. However, constrained by domain-specific
knowledge, a single model can only handle the operation requirement of a
specific task,such as log parser,root cause analysis. Meanwhile, combining
multiple models can achieve more efficient results, which have been proved in
both previous ensemble learning and the recent LLM training domain. Inspired by
these works,to address the similar challenges in AIOPS, this paper first
proposes a collaboration-of-expert framework(CoE-Ops) incorporating a
general-purpose large language model task classifier. A retrieval-augmented
generation mechanism is introduced to improve the framework's capability in
handling both Question-Answering tasks with high-level(Code,build,Test,etc.)
and low-level(fault analysis,anomaly detection,etc.). Finally, the proposed
method is implemented in the AIOps domain, and extensive experiments are
conducted on the DevOps-EVAL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
CoE-Ops achieves a 72% improvement in routing accuracy for high-level AIOps
tasks compared to existing CoE methods, delivers up to 8% accuracy enhancement
over single AIOps models in DevOps problem resolution, and outperforms
larger-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by up to 14% in accuracy.

Motivation: 技术文档中的问答常涉及图表内容，传统文本RAG系统难以处理这类问题。

Method: 利用VLM从流程图中提取图表示，并将其整合到文本RAG系统中，实现图像检索。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在电信领域QA数据集上表现良好，图表示与真实值编辑距离更低，检索性能优越。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了问答性能，还避免了推理时使用VLM，降低了部署成本。

Abstract: Question-Answering (QA) from technical documents often involves questions
whose answers are present in figures, such as flowcharts or flow diagrams.
Text-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may fail to answer such
questions. We leverage graph representations of flowcharts obtained from Visual
large Language Models (VLMs) and incorporate them in a text-based RAG system to
show that this approach can enable image retrieval for QA in the telecom
domain. We present the end-to-end approach from processing technical documents,
classifying image types, building graph representations, and incorporating them
with the text embedding pipeline for efficient retrieval. We benchmark the same
on a QA dataset created based on proprietary telecom product information
documents. Results show that the graph representations obtained using a
fine-tuned VLM model have lower edit distance with respect to the ground truth,
which illustrate the robustness of these representations for flowchart images.
Further, the approach for QA using these representations gives good retrieval
performance using text-based embedding models, including a telecom-domain
adapted one. Our approach also alleviates the need for a VLM in inference,
which is an important cost benefit for deployed QA systems.

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate PARROT (Polyglottal
Annotated Radiology Reports for Open Testing), a large, multicentric,
open-access dataset of fictional radiology reports spanning multiple languages
for testing natural language processing applications in radiology. Materials
and Methods: From May to September 2024, radiologists were invited to
contribute fictional radiology reports following their standard reporting
practices. Contributors provided at least 20 reports with associated metadata
including anatomical region, imaging modality, clinical context, and for
non-English reports, English translations. All reports were assigned ICD-10
codes. A human vs. AI report differentiation study was conducted with 154
participants (radiologists, healthcare professionals, and non-healthcare
professionals) assessing whether reports were human-authored or AI-generated.
Results: The dataset comprises 2,658 radiology reports from 76 authors across
21 countries and 13 languages. Reports cover multiple imaging modalities (CT:
36.1%, MRI: 22.8%, radiography: 19.0%, ultrasound: 16.8%) and anatomical
regions, with chest (19.9%), abdomen (18.6%), head (17.3%), and pelvis (14.1%)
being most prevalent. In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%
accuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated
reports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:
53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the
largest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and
validation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在推理步骤中事实错误的问题，避免高风险领域的误导决策。

Method: 结合事实检查分类器、GRPO强化学习和可解释性模块。

Result: 显著提升事实准确性（最高49.9%改进），并在多个基准测试中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: RELIANCE为未来通过激活引导优化提升事实稳健性的训练方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy
for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical
vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual
inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers.
This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including
healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet
confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our
framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking
classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual
inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality,
coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and
(3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements
manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation
across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading
models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of
only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual
robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving
performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA.
Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into
how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model
architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that
explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生存分析方法难以有效处理文本数据的复杂性，尤其是时序形式的临床报告。

Method: SigBERT通过提取和平均词嵌入为句子嵌入，利用粗糙路径理论的签名提取捕获时序动态，并将几何特征整合到LASSO惩罚的Cox模型中。

Result: 在真实世界肿瘤数据集上，SigBERT的C-index得分为0.75（标准差0.014）。

Conclusion: SigBERT通过整合时序医疗数据，提升了风险估计能力，推动了基于叙事的生存分析。

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that
can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However,
existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the
complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we
propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to
efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT
processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word
embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time
series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from
rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which
significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal
dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model
to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated
on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a
C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT
integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing
narrative-based survival analysis.

Motivation: 在大规模索赔数据库分析中，验证基于代码的算法的测量特性是提高结果可靠性的关键，但传统手动图表审查耗时耗力。

Method: 采用NLP减少人工审查时间，并结合多波自适应采样和预定义停止规则，以高效完成验证。

Result: NLP辅助审查使每张图表审查时间减少40%，多波采样方法可避免77%的图表审查，且不影响测量精度。

Conclusion: 该方法可促进更频繁的算法验证，提升数据库研究结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims
databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based
algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of
interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the
robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from
outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are
typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart
review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We
describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study
us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to
reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave
adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation
study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient
precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the
performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in
patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the
NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by
40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have
prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision
in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could
facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key
study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of
find-ings derived from database studies.

Motivation: 挑战传统批判观点，将任意性视为符号学特性，支持系统有效运作。

Method: 基于索绪尔的符号任意性理论，扩展至法律和社会动态，提出“动机→可观察性→可争议性”链。

Result: 形式化任意性为条件熵A=H(L|M)，揭示其作为控制和关怀中性操作者的作用。

Conclusion: 任意性是结构设计的一部分，保护权威免于问责，并为AI系统可解释性提供新视角。

Abstract: This article redefines arbitrariness not as a normative flaw or a symptom of
domination, but as a foundational functional mechanism structuring human
systems and interactions. Diverging from critical traditions that conflate
arbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a
property enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate
effectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand
de Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this
principle beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,
particularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the "Motivation
-> Constatability -> Contestability" chain, arguing that motivation functions
as a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective
contestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like
"immotivization" or "Conflict Lateralization" (exemplified by "the blur of the
wolf drowned in the fish"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their
rationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while
appearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from
accountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes
arbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern
theory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as
care, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily
developed through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new
pathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence
systems.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了SDMs评估的空白，为未来改进SDMs在口语对话中的应用提供了基础。

Abstract: Spoken Dialogue Models (SDMs) have recently attracted significant attention
for their ability to generate voice responses directly to users' spoken
queries. Despite their increasing popularity, there exists a gap in research
focused on comprehensively understanding their practical effectiveness in
comprehending and emulating human conversations. This is especially true
compared to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), which benefit from
extensive benchmarking. Human voice interactions are inherently more complex
than text due to characteristics unique to spoken dialogue. Ambiguity poses one
challenge, stemming from semantic factors like polysemy, as well as
phonological aspects such as heterograph, heteronyms, and stress patterns.
Additionally, context-dependency, like omission, coreference, and multi-turn
interaction, adds further complexity to human conversational dynamics. To
illuminate the current state of SDM development and to address these
challenges, we present a benchmark dataset in this paper, which comprises 1,079
instances in English and Chinese. Accompanied by an LLM-based evaluation method
that closely aligns with human judgment, this dataset facilitates a
comprehensive exploration of the performance of SDMs in tackling these
practical challenges.

Result: LLMs在某些情况下表现接近人类标注，但在数学语言推理上仍有困难。

Conclusion: LLMs在Math NLI中有潜力，但需改进数学语言处理能力；提供语料库支持未来研究。

Abstract: We ask whether contemporary LLMs are able to perform natural language
inference (NLI) tasks on mathematical texts. We call this the Math NLI problem.
We construct a corpus of Math NLI pairs whose premises are from extant
mathematical text and whose hypotheses and gold labels were provided by people
with experience in both research-level mathematics and also in the NLI field.
We also investigate the quality of corpora using the same premises but whose
hypotheses are provided by LLMs themselves. We not only investigate the
performance but also the inter-group consistency of the diverse group of LLMs.
We have both positive and negative findings. Among our positive findings: in
some settings, using a majority vote of LLMs is approximately equivalent to
using human-labeled data in the Math NLI area. On the negative side: LLMs still
struggle with mathematical language. They occasionally fail at even basic
inferences. Current models are not as prone to hypothesis-only "inference" in
our data the way the previous generation had been. In addition to our findings,
we also provide our corpora as data to support future work on Math NLI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无需微调大语言模型的方法，利用上下文学习完成框架语义解析任务。

Method: 提出一种自动生成任务特定提示的方法，基于FrameNet数据库构建提示，用于指导六种不同的大语言模型。

Result: 在暴力事件相关框架子集上，FI的F1得分为94.3%，FSRL为77.4%。

Conclusion: 上下文学习为领域特定FSP任务提供了一种实用且有效的替代传统微调的方法。

Abstract: Frame Semantic Parsing (FSP) entails identifying predicates and labeling
their arguments according to Frame Semantics. This paper investigates the use
of In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform FSP
without model fine-tuning. We propose a method that automatically generates
task-specific prompts for the Frame Identification (FI) and Frame Semantic Role
Labeling (FSRL) subtasks, relying solely on the FrameNet database. These
prompts, constructed from frame definitions and annotated examples, are used to
guide six different LLMs. Experiments are conducted on a subset of frames
related to violent events. The method achieves competitive results, with F1
scores of 94.3% for FI and 77.4% for FSRL. The findings suggest that ICL offers
a practical and effective alternative to traditional fine-tuning for
domain-specific FSP tasks.

*Ali Veisi,Delaram Fartoot,Hamidreza Amirzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARoPE是一种新型的位置编码方法，通过动态生成与上下文相关的频率模式，改进了传统的RoPE，显著提升了Transformer模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE虽然高效且兼容相对位置编码，但其静态的频率模式限制了上下文敏感关系的建模能力。CARoPE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: CARoPE通过动态生成与token嵌入相关的频率模式，引入上下文敏感的位置表示，同时保持RoPE的高效性和架构简洁性。

Result: 在FineWeb-Edu-10B数据集上，CARoPE显著降低了困惑度，并在长上下文长度下表现更优，同时训练速度更快。

Conclusion: CARoPE为Transformer模型提供了一种可扩展、表达力强且高效的位置编码升级方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is a vital component of Transformer architectures,
enabling models to incorporate sequence order into self-attention mechanisms.
Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have become a widely adopted solution due
to their compatibility with relative position encoding and computational
efficiency. However, RoPE relies on static, input-independent sinusoidal
frequency patterns, limiting its ability to model context-sensitive
relationships. In this work, we propose CARoPE (Context-Aware Rotary Positional
Embedding), a novel generalization of RoPE that dynamically generates
head-specific frequency patterns conditioned on token embeddings. This design
introduces token- and context-sensitive positional representations while
preserving RoPE efficiency and architectural simplicity. CARoPE computes
input-dependent phase shifts using a bounded transformation of token embeddings
and integrates them into the rotary mechanism across attention heads. We
evaluate CARoPE on the FineWeb-Edu-10B dataset using GPT-2 variants trained on
next-token prediction tasks. Experimental results show that CARoPE consistently
outperforms RoPE and other common positional encoding baselines, achieving
significantly lower perplexity, even at longer context lengths. Additionally,
CARoPE enables faster training throughput without sacrificing model stability.
These findings demonstrate that CARoPE offers a scalable, expressive, and
efficient upgrade to existing positional encoding strategies in Transformer
models.

TL;DR: SMART-Editor是一个支持结构化与非结构化领域布局和内容编辑的框架，通过Reward-Refine和RewardDPO策略保持全局一致性，并在多域编辑场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型在编辑时缺乏全局一致性的问题，提出一种能够跨领域保持语义和视觉对齐的编辑框架。

Method: 采用Reward-Refine（推理时奖励引导细化）和RewardDPO（训练时奖励对齐布局优化）两种策略。

Result: 在SMARTEdit-Bench基准测试中，SMART-Editor优于InstructPix2Pix和HIVE，RewardDPO在结构化场景中提升15%，Reward-Refine在自然图像中表现更优。

Conclusion: 奖励引导的规划能有效生成语义一致且视觉对齐的编辑结果，自动和人工评估均验证了其价值。

Abstract: We present SMART-Editor, a framework for compositional layout and content
editing across structured (posters, websites) and unstructured (natural images)
domains. Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves
global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time
rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference
optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model
performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain,
cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like
InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in
structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images.
Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in
producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组件检索的架构，用于解决大规模数据库自然语言接口的扩展性问题，无需领域微调即可高效检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖领域微调且未能充分利用数据库元数据的语义信息，限制了在大型企业级数据目录中的扩展性。

Method: 将数据库模式和元数据分解为离散语义单元，分别索引以实现针对性检索，优先识别有效表并控制检索表的数量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高召回率和准确性上优于基线，适用于不同结构和元数据的大规模数据库。

Conclusion: 该方案解决了自然语言数据库接口的关键扩展性问题，适用于多样化企业环境。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language
interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an
under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on
domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage
important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these
limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that
decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each
separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective
table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the
total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget.
Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy,
with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying
structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL
systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized
fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database
interfaces.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在中文文本歧义中的表现，发现其处理歧义时存在显著脆弱性，与人类行为差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在遇到歧义文本时的可信度问题，特别是中文文本歧义。

Method: 构建包含歧义句及其消歧对的基准数据集，分为3大类9小类，通过实验分析LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs无法可靠区分歧义文本，对歧义文本表现出过度自信和过度思考，与人类行为差异显著。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在语言歧义处理上存在根本性限制，需改进方法以应对现实应用中的不确定性。

Abstract: In this work, we study a critical research problem regarding the
trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs): how LLMs behave when
encountering ambiguous narrative text, with a particular focus on Chinese
textual ambiguity. We created a benchmark dataset by collecting and generating
ambiguous sentences with context and their corresponding disambiguated pairs,
representing multiple possible interpretations. These annotated examples are
systematically categorized into 3 main categories and 9 subcategories. Through
experiments, we discovered significant fragility in LLMs when handling
ambiguity, revealing behavior that differs substantially from humans.
Specifically, LLMs cannot reliably distinguish ambiguous text from unambiguous
text, show overconfidence in interpreting ambiguous text as having a single
meaning rather than multiple meanings, and exhibit overthinking when attempting
to understand the various possible meanings. Our findings highlight a
fundamental limitation in current LLMs that has significant implications for
their deployment in real-world applications where linguistic ambiguity is
common, calling for improved approaches to handle uncertainty in language
understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available at this GitHub

TL;DR: ISO-Bench是一个评估多模态模型因果推理能力的基准，结果显示当前模型表现不佳，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多模态间的因果关系是现实环境中多模态模型的核心挑战。

Method: 通过图像和文本片段的任务步骤对比，评估模型判断视觉步骤与文本步骤的时序关系。

Result: 十种前沿视觉语言模型的零样本F1最高仅0.57，思维链推理略有提升（最高0.62），远低于人类（0.98）。

Conclusion: 研究为提升多模态模型的因果理解能力提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships across modalities is a core challenge for
multimodal models operating in real-world environments. We introduce ISO-Bench,
a benchmark for evaluating whether models can infer causal dependencies between
visual observations and procedural text. Each example presents an image of a
task step and a text snippet from a plan, with the goal of deciding whether the
visual step occurs before or after the referenced text step. Evaluation results
on ten frontier vision-language models show underwhelming performance: the best
zero-shot F1 is only 0.57, and chain-of-thought reasoning yields only modest
gains (up to 0.62 F1), largely behind humans (0.98 F1). Our analysis further
highlights concrete directions for improving causal understanding in multimodal
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究从用户与语言模型（LM）交互日志中提取隐式用户反馈，分析其内容和极性对模型性能的影响，发现反馈内容在简单任务中有效，但在复杂任务中效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在不直接打扰用户的情况下，通过隐式用户反馈持续优化语言模型。

Method: 分析两个用户-LM交互数据集（WildChat和LMSYS），研究反馈内容和极性对模型性能的影响。

Result: 反馈内容在简单任务（MTBench）中提升模型性能，但在复杂任务（WildBench）中无效；反馈效果与用户初始提示质量相关。

Conclusion: 隐式用户反馈具有潜力，但其效果受任务复杂性和用户提示质量限制。

Abstract: Once language models (LMs) are deployed, they can interact with users
long-term, ideally evolving continuously based on their feedback. Asking for
direct user feedback can be disruptive; thus, we study harvesting user feedback
from user-LM interaction logs. We study implicit user feedback in two user-LM
interaction datasets (WildChat and LMSYS). First, we analyze user feedback in
the user-LLM conversation trajectory, providing insights into when and why such
feedback occurs. Second, we study harvesting learning signals from such
implicit user feedback. We find that the contents of user feedback (e.g., user
wanted clarification), not just the polarity (e.g., users were unhappy with the
previous model response), can improve model performance in short human-designed
questions (MTBench) but not on longer and more complex questions (WildBench).
We also find that the usefulness of user feedback is largely tied to the
quality of the user's initial prompt. Together, we provide an in-depth study of
implicit user feedback, showing its potential and limitations.

*Jizhou Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LENS是一种通过分析内部表示来学习模型置信度的新方法，用于优化多LLM的预测组合，显著优于传统集成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成方法（如投票或对数集成）忽略了模型在不同上下文中的置信度和可靠性差异，需要更精细的加权策略。

Method: LENS通过训练轻量级线性置信度预测器，利用层间隐藏状态和归一化概率作为输入，动态调整模型预测权重。

Result: 在多选和布尔问答任务中，LENS显著优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: 内部表示为模型置信度提供了有价值的信号，可用于高效集成学习。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific
abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial
for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble
methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which
overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different
contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from
Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by
analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear
confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized
probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model
predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not
require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional
computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean
question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble
methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal
representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and
can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习工作负载的复杂性和多样性增加，自动化低层内核开发成为必要，以满足性能和生产力需求。

Method: GEAK采用推理时计算缩放和Reflexion式反馈机制，生成针对AMD GPU的Triton代码。

Result: GEAK在正确性上提升63%，执行速度提升2.59倍。

Conclusion: GEAK展示了代理式代码生成在加速硬件平台采用和普及专家级内核性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the
need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia.
As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative
to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity
demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research
institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs,
aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert
performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based
DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated
kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we
present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating
Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs
to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD
MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce
Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style
feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly
outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as
Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and
execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of
GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse
hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注正样本的利用，忽视了负样本在上下文学习中的潜在价值。

Method: 基于Zero-Shot-Cot构建正负样本库，通过语义相似性选择正负样本，并进一步优化正样本选择。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于仅依赖正样本的方法，验证了负样本信息的有效性。

Conclusion: 负样本信息有助于优化正样本选择，从而提升ICL性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models exhibit powerful few-shot in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, but the performance is highly sensitive to provided examples.
  Recent research has focused on retrieving corresponding examples for each
input query, not only enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the learning
process but also mitigating inherent biases in manual example selection.
  However, these studies have primarily emphasized leveraging Positive samples
while overlooking the additional information within Negative samples for
contextual learning.
  We propose a novel method that utilizes Negative samples to better select
Positive sample examples, thereby enhancing the performance of few-shot ICL.
Initially, we construct Positive and Negative sample corpora based on
Zero-Shot-Cot. Then, during inference, we employ a semantic similarity-based
approach to select the most similar examples from both the Positive and
Negative corpora for a given query. Subsequently, we further retrieve Positive
examples from the Positive sample corpus based on semantic similarity to the
Negative examples, then concatenating them with the previously selected
Positive examples to serve as ICL demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach surpasses methods solely relying on the most
similar positive examples for context, validating that the additional
information in negative samples aids in enhancing ICL performance through
improved Positive sample selection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型因依赖词袋表示，难以捕捉语义抽象特征，而神经变体同样受限于词列表表达。

Method: 提出MTMs，基于稀疏自编码器学习特征，定义主题于语义丰富空间，并引入基于LLM的评估框架。

Result: MTMs在五个数据集上表现优于传统和神经基线，且能有效控制LLM输出。

Conclusion: MTMs在主题表达和生成控制方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large
text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words
representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While
some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained
by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate
complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic
models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders
(SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal
deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover,
uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using
topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against
word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based
pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or
exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently
preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的早期准确诊断需要分析多种异构生物标志物，而大型语言模型（LLMs）在结构化生物医学数据预测方面具有潜力。

Method: 通过上下文学习构建少量样本的表格提示，并利用参数高效的qLoRA适配微调TableGPT2，进行AD或认知正常（CN）的二元分类。

Conclusion: 这是首次将LLMs应用于表格生物标志物数据预测任务，为未来生物医学信息学中的多智能体框架奠定了基础。

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex
neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal
fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible
few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based
interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a
novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts
TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for
business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data
with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using
in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes
TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary
classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework
harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the
encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose
LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To
our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task
using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent
frameworks in biomedical informatics.

Abstract: There has been an increase in recent advancements in the explainability and
development of personalized chatbots for mental health. However, the reasoning
aspects for explainability and dialogue discourse have not been explored
previously for mental health. Hence, we are investigating the pragmatic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) in this domain. We
introduce P-ReMe dataset, and propose a modified definition for the pragmatic
phenomena of implicature (implied meaning) and presupposition (implicit
assumption) in mental health. Following the definition, we formulate two tasks
in implicature and one task in presupposition. To benchmark the dataset and the
presented tasks, we consider four models - Llama3.1, Mistral, MentaLLaMa, and
Qwen. The results of the experiments suggest that Mistral and Qwen show
substantial reasoning capabilities in the domain. In addition, we also propose
StiPRompts to study the stigma around mental health with the state-of-the-art
LLMs, GPT-4o mini, Deepseek-chat, and Claude-3.5-haiku. Our evaluated findings
show that Claude-3.5-haiku deals with the stigma more responsibly compared to
the other two LLMs.

Result: 发现孟加拉语性能普遍低于英语，分词效率与模型准确性成反比，某些架构（如DeepSeek）表现稳健。

Conclusion: 需改进数据集质量和评估方法，推动多语言NLP研究，促进语言技术普及。

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains
a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational
constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that
hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized
evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language
Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive
error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal
consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for
smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified
promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain
more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse
relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend
to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient
\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings
highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the
need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to
multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for
underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language
technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly

Motivation: 探索MoE模型中专家的重要性差异，揭示关键子集的作用。

Method: 通过分析激活异常和修剪实验，识别并验证SEs的重要性。

Result: SEs对模型性能（尤其是数学推理）有显著影响，且其分布不受后训练影响。

Conclusion: SEs是MoE模型的关键组成部分，修剪会破坏注意力分布，影响模型表现。

Abstract: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promise in
enhancing the learning capacity of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the
intrinsic importance differences among experts, recent research has explored
expert-level compression techniques to improve the efficiency of MoE LLMs.
However, existing approaches often rely on empirical criteria to identify
critical experts, lacking a deeper exploration and understanding of the
heterogeneous importance of experts. In this study, we present the first
discovery and investigation of a distinct subset of experts that play a crucial
role in the underlying mechanisms during the model's forward inference. These
experts are prevalent in open-source MoE LLMs, and despite their limited
number, pruning them leads to a significant decline in model performance (e.g.,
pruning three causes Qwen3-30B-A3B to produce repetitive and uninformative
outputs). We refer to these experts as Super Experts (SEs). Our comprehensive
analysis provides progressively deeper insights into SEs. (i) SEs are
characterized by rare but extreme activation outliers in the output of the
down_proj, which give rise to massive activations in the hidden states between
decoder layers. Moreover, the distribution of SEs remains model-specific and is
unaffected by post-training processes. (ii) By pruning SEs, we assess their
significance across a variety of tasks, revealing their considerable impact on
the model's overall performance, particularly in mathematical reasoning. (iii)
We further enhance our understanding of the influence of SEs compression. Our
findings confirm that MoE LLMs rely on SEs to induce attention sinks, which are
crucial for the distribution of attention scores but are significantly
disrupted by SE pruning. The code is available at

zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related
applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of
music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we
propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question
answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to
LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to
questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a
music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes
context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to
effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our
experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional
fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities,
showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA
benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective
than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and
computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否会在无明确指令下隐式净化语言，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过实验分析GPT-4o-mini在改写敏感内容时的隐式净化行为，并评估其零样本分类能力。

Result: GPT-4o-mini能系统性地降低敏感内容，显著减少贬义和禁忌语言，且在零样本分类中表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLMs具备隐式净化语言的能力，且在零样本分类任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown tendencies toward
politeness, formality, and implicit content moderation. While previous research
has primarily focused on explicitly training models to moderate and detoxify
sensitive content, there has been limited exploration of whether LLMs
implicitly sanitize language without explicit instructions. This study
empirically analyzes the implicit moderation behavior of GPT-4o-mini when
paraphrasing sensitive content and evaluates the extent of sensitivity shifts.
Our experiments indicate that GPT-4o-mini systematically moderates content
toward less sensitive classes, with substantial reductions in derogatory and
taboo language. Also, we evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in
classifying sentence sensitivity, comparing their performances against
traditional methods.

Motivation: 解决LLMs依赖参数化知识导致的解释性和可信度问题，同时避免手动标注或监督训练的需求。

Method: 结合LLM的SQL编程能力和对话理论，无监督地从零构建任务导向对话本体。

Result: TeQoDO在对话状态跟踪任务中表现优于迁移学习方法，且能扩展到构建更大规模的本体。

Conclusion: TeQoDO为提升LLM解释性提供了新途径，展示了无监督本体构建的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as general-purpose knowledge
sources, but they rely on parametric knowledge, limiting explainability and
trustworthiness. In task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, this separation is
explicit, using an external database structured by an explicit ontology to
ensure explainability and controllability. However, building such ontologies
requires manual labels or supervised training. We introduce TeQoDO: a
Text-to-SQL task-oriented Dialogue Ontology construction method. Here, an LLM
autonomously builds a TOD ontology from scratch without supervision using its
inherent SQL programming capabilities combined with dialogue theory provided in
the prompt. We show that TeQoDO outperforms transfer learning approaches, and
its constructed ontology is competitive on a downstream dialogue state tracking
task. Ablation studies demonstrate the key role of dialogue theory. TeQoDO also
scales to allow construction of much larger ontologies, which we investigate on
a Wikipedia and ArXiv dataset. We view this as a step towards broader
application of ontologies to increase LLM explainability.

TL;DR: MPCC是首个评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）处理多模态约束规划能力的基准，通过真实任务和复杂约束揭示当前模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法直接评估多模态真实世界规划能力，且缺乏跨模态约束。

Method: 提出MPCC基准，包含航班、日历和会议规划任务，引入预算、时间和空间等复杂约束，并分难度级别。

Result: 实验显示，闭源模型仅生成21.3%可行计划，开源模型低于11%，且模型对约束复杂度敏感。

Conclusion: MPCC为多模态约束规划提供严格评估框架，凸显约束感知推理在MLLM应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and
design steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for
complex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current
benchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal
real-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit
constraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal
Planning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically
evaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To
address the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight
Planning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second
challenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and
spatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to
separate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13
advanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only
21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,
we observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that
traditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.
Our work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous
evaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in
constraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.

TL;DR: Causal2Vec是一种针对解码器专用大语言模型（LLM）的嵌入模型，通过预编码输入文本为Contextual token并优化池化策略，显著提升性能且降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在去除因果注意力掩码或依赖额外输入时，可能损害LLM的语义提取能力或增加计算开销，Causal2Vec旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用轻量级BERT模型预编码输入为Contextual token，将其添加到LLM输入序列，并优化池化策略（结合Contextual和EOS token的隐藏状态）。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中达到最优性能，同时减少序列长度85%和推理时间82%。

Conclusion: Causal2Vec在不改变LLM架构或显著增加计算成本的情况下，显著提升了嵌入模型的性能。

Abstract: Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to build
embedding models that effectively encode the semantic information of natural
language texts into dense vector representations for various embedding tasks.
However, many existing methods primarily focus on removing the causal attention
mask in LLMs to enable bidirectional attention, potentially undermining the
model's ability to extract semantic information acquired during pretraining.
Additionally, leading unidirectional approaches often rely on extra input text
to overcome the inherent limitations of causal attention, inevitably increasing
computational costs. In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose
embedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs
without altering their original architectures or introducing significant
computational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style
model to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is
then prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture
contextualized information even without attending to future tokens.
Furthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and
help LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual
token, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as
the final text embedding. In practice, Causal2Vec achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) among models
trained solely on publicly available retrieval datasets, while reducing the
required sequence length by up to 85% and inference time by up to 82% compared
to best-performing methods.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可以通过微调实现角色特定的行为控制，为实际企业应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
settings, controlling model behavior based on user roles becomes an essential
requirement. Existing safety methods typically assume uniform access and focus
on preventing harmful or toxic outputs, without addressing role-specific access
constraints. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be fine-tuned to
generate responses that reflect the access privileges associated with different
organizational roles. We explore three modeling strategies: a BERT-based
classifier, an LLM-based classifier, and role-conditioned generation. To
evaluate these approaches, we construct two complementary datasets. The first
is adapted from existing instruction-tuning corpora through clustering and role
labeling, while the second is synthetically generated to reflect realistic,
role-sensitive enterprise scenarios. We assess model performance across varying
organizational structures and analyze robustness to prompt injection, role
mismatch, and jailbreak attempts.

Result: 生成的解释在正确性和清晰度上表现良好，但仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在解释逻辑规则方面具有潜力，未来研究需进一步优化。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the
inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the
completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential
errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for
reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined
with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for
humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language
models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules.
Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery
algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets,
FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including
zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and
chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the
generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and
also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results
demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and
clarity, although several challenges remain for future research. All scripts

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models presents both opportunities
and challenges for the translation field. While commercial, cloud-based AI
chatbots have garnered significant attention in translation studies, concerns
regarding data privacy, security, and equitable access necessitate exploration
of alternative deployment models. This paper investigates the feasibility and
performance of locally deployable, free language models as a viable alternative
to proprietary, cloud-based AI solutions. This study evaluates three
open-source models installed on CPU-based platforms and compared against
commercially available online chat-bots. The evaluation focuses on functional
performance rather than a comparative analysis of human-machine translation
quality, an area already subject to extensive research. The platforms assessed
were chosen for their accessibility and ease of use across various operating
systems. While local deployment introduces its own challenges, the benefits of
enhanced data control, improved privacy, and reduced dependency on cloud
services are compelling. The findings of this study contribute to a growing
body of knowledge concerning the democratization of AI technology and inform
future research and development efforts aimed at making LLMs more accessible
and practical for a wider range of users, specifically focusing on the needs of
individual translators and small businesses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多文档摘要的核心挑战是文档间关系的复杂性和信息冗余。现有方法通常仅考虑单关系图且需预定义聚类数量，限制了其性能。

Method: 构建多关系图整合语义和语篇关系，应用二维结构熵最小化算法自动聚类，并通过位置感知压缩机制生成摘要。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有无监督方法，部分情况下接近监督模型和大语言模型性能。

Conclusion: MRGSEM-Sum生成的摘要具有高一致性和覆盖性，接近人工水平。

Abstract: The core challenge faced by multi-document summarization is the complexity of
relationships among documents and the presence of information redundancy. Graph
clustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the
complex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces
information redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research
progress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational
graphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability
to fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition
sentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose
MRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on
multi-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we
construct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse
relations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic
connections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional
structural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically
determining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences
into coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression
mechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative
summaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,
DUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves
performance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human
evaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high
consistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.

Abstract: Arabic poses a particular challenge for natural language processing (NLP) and
information retrieval (IR) due to its complex morphology, optional diacritics

Despite the growing global significance of Arabic, it is still underrepresented
in NLP research and benchmark resources. In this paper, we present an enhanced
Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) framework developed specifically for Arabic. At
the core of our approach is a novel Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) that
replaces standard interaction mechanisms with an adaptive scoring function that
more effectively models the semantic relevance between questions and passages.
Our method integrates pre-trained Arabic language models and architectural
refinements to improve retrieval performance and significantly increase ranking
accuracy when answering Arabic questions. The code is made publicly available

Motivation: 现有AI系统主要采用被动批判性思维，仅拒绝问题查询而不主动解决用户需求，限制了其协作能力。

Method: 提出主动批判性思维范式，设计GSM-MC和GSM-MCE两个数学推理基准，并通过强化学习算法提升模型能力。

Result: 实验显示，现有模型（如Qwen3和Llama系列）在主动批判性思维任务上表现较差，但强化学习显著提升了Qwen3-1.7B的准确率（从0.15%到73.98%）。

Conclusion: 主动批判性思维能有效提升AI与用户的协作能力，强化学习是实现这一目标的有力工具。

Abstract: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing
them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior
work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply
reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user
requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm
where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to
resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC
and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical
reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math
problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify
and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty
by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.
Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models
excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and
inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,
especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning
(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,
we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to
73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more
effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

Conclusion: CSEDB为LLMs临床评估提供标准化指标，有助于改进和推广其在医疗中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but
face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We
developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a
multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30
criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline
adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures.
Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A
items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate
real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall
performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%),
with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001).
Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over
general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and
effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a
standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs,
facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and
improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential

Conclusion: Med-R³通过联合优化检索与推理，解决了医学领域中的关键挑战，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and
leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance.
Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing
either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with
little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited
coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize
existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization
ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some
studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general
domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not
adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these
challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented
**R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In
this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical
reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation,
we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the
characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization
throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the
model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate
that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by
3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with
Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

Conclusion: T-Detect提供了一种新的统计基础，验证了其鲁棒性，并在对抗性条件下表现出色。代码已开源。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated text generation models necessitates the
development of robust detection methods capable of identifying
machine-generated content, particularly text designed to evade detection
through adversarial perturbations. Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on
statistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise
that falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts
characteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper
introduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the
statistical core of curvature-based detectors. Our primary innovation is the
replacement of standard Gaussian normalization with a heavy-tailed discrepancy
score derived from the Student's t-distribution. This approach is theoretically
grounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit
significant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions
inadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the
log-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,
providing superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach
on the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive
HART dataset. Experiments show that T-Detect provides a consistent performance
uplift over strong baselines, improving AUROC by up to 3.9\% in targeted
domains. When integrated into a two-dimensional detection framework (CT), our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an AUROC of 0.926 on the
Books domain of RAID. Our contributions are a new, theoretically-justified
statistical foundation for text detection, an ablation-validated method that
demonstrates superior robustness, and a comprehensive analysis of its
performance under adversarial conditions. Ours code are released at

adaptation of the differential attention mechanism, with low-rank adapters on
both positive and negative attention terms. This approach retains the
efficiency of LoRA while aiming to benefit from the performance gains of
differential attention. We evaluate DiffLoRA across a broad range of NLP tasks,
including general benchmarks, many-shot in-context learning, RAG, and
long-context tests. We observe that, although DiffLoRA falls short of other
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in most evaluation tasks, it shows
interesting results in certain domains (+11 pts on LoRA for HumanEval). We
analyze the attention patterns post-finetuning to identify the reasons for this
behavior.

Abstract: Hate speech identification in social media has become an increasingly
important issue in recent years. In this research, we address two problems: 1)
to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate
speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars
based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we
conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to
determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we
consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence
containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the
dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech
detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text
cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached
0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state
of the art machine translation systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QA基准测试是间接评估LLMs问题解决能力的方法，需要更直接且可扩展的评估框架。

Method: 采用级联问题披露方法，分阶段揭示问题信息，以激发LLMs的广义推理能力。

Result: 该方法不仅改进了LLMs之间的比较，还生成了更好的中间推理痕迹，缩小了标准QA评估中的性能差距。

Conclusion: 级联问题披露框架提供了更准确的模型能力评估，表明标准QA评估可能高估了模型间的性能差异。

Abstract: While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and
scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their
underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and
generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that
provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities
while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model
responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information
about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find
that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also
induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA
paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and
knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.
Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation
settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation
overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further
validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.
