Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on\ndiscriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task\nformulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address\nthese critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which\ncomprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual\nfeatures for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.\nBuilding on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive\nDynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).\nTDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and\ndestination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node\ngeneration to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.\nTo enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the\nstructural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further\npropose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for\nreproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key\ninsights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in\nDyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for\nadvancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical\napplications in DyTAG generation.

We propose a modular\nactor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a\ntrajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).\nOur setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the\nguarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural\nlanguage observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes\nnew LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize\nplanning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to\nanalyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules\nthat improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft\ndiamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving\nefficiency compared to baseline LLM planners.

However, traditional approaches rely\non human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often\noverlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other\nmulti-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory\nSynergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language\nmodels as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and\nphenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of\nconcept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --\nspanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which\nspontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,\nself-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical\ncorrelations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for\nphenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's\ncapabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the\nheart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging\nphenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional\nconfounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on\ndiagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve\nperformance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences\nas small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks.

However, the concepts are\nfrequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy\ndiscourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain\nunder meaningful human supervision.\n  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision\noutside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to\nAI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and\noperational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either\na policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims\nto prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,\nremediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight\nstrategies nonetheless necessitate control.\n  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a\ntheoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the\nconditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and\nwhat is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how\nsupervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,\nand drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a\nmaturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some\nboundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,\nand where it is clear that no existing methods suffice.

These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the\nstrengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.\nHere, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary\nresearch, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration\nacross diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the\ncapabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational\nbiology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how\niterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary\ncollaboration and research.

As agents and their environments grow\nmore complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but\ncritical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box\ntesting technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable\nagent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training\nflaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse\nenvironmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying\nconfigurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling.

Current research\nbroadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible\nwithin a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a\ngiven unsatisfiable formula.\n  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named\nMUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for\nits strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for\nspecifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into\nanswer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of\nstate-of-the-art ASP systems.

To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce\nanswers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.\nUncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality\nof LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among\nthese methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown\nparticular promise, as these internal representations encode information\nrelevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this\npaper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often\nstruggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To\naddress this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with\nhidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances\nout-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most\ninformative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,\nenables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The\nexperiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features\ngenerally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain\nscenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when\nretaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic\nfeatures does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using\nthe full set of hidden-state features.

The former treats all temporal information of each variable as\na token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,\nwhile the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each\ntime step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current\nmainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.\nTransformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention\nmechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and\nsuffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in\nlong-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models\n(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but\nstruggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome\nthe limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel\nforecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series\nforecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a\nchannel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the\nTransformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model\ncross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two\ndistinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These\nrepresentations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a\ntemporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively.

An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL\ncorpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all\nmentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.\nThis imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body\nrepresentation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance.

However, current approaches face\na critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional\ncorrectness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA).

In\ncontrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after\ngeneration are often inefficient because they operate externally without\nupdating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic\ndesign capabilities.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven\nreinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that\nachieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1\nemploys a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on\nsyntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from\nsynthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness.

However, these\nrationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to\nwasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe\nthat verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct\nregions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and\ninjecting a \"steering vector\" to transition between these modes, we can\nreliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively\ncompressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as\nActivation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens\nreasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,\nderived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate\nsteering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC\nachieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,\nwhile maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a\ntraining-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on\nMATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock\ntime on an 8B model.

Our approach utilizes a\nvariational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.\nThis latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.\nSubsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering\nthe data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each\ntype of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to\npreviously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization\nalgorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.\nWe assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,\nposing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination\nacross a wide range of possible strategies.

These\nfindings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a\npost-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for\nthe distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the\nkey property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce\na conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from\nCoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require\ncomplex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating\nthe experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad\nbehavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose\nits reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to\nstress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these\nguidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only\nwhen given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or\niterative optimization against the monitor.
