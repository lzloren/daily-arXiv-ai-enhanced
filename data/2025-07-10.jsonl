Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of\nhigh-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings\noffer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and\noperations across the joint force."}

We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach\nto prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing\nprompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while\ncapturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and\nexternal tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL\naims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative\nrepresentation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's\nutility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the\nprompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement\ncompared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern."}

Introduced in the 1970s by\nRoberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working\nmathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.\nDialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an\nautomated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief\nmanagement.\n  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:\n(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be\ninconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding\na counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an\nopen problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are\nstrictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known\nto be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights\nthe complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief\nrevision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and\nresearch communities."}

SCC-recursiveness\nis a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is\ndecomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack\ngraph, proceeding recursively from \"higher\" to \"lower\" components. While\nSCC-recursive semantics such as \\cft and \\stgt have proven effective for finite\nAFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to\ngeneralize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.\n  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite\nsetting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's\nestablished criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in\ngeneral. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,\nwhere we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results\nadvance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for\nreasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains."}

Although current instruction\ndatasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may\nstill struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.\nThis is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of\ntask types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the\ninstruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction\ndata construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,\nan informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis\nprocess, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These\ncomponents form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage\nand depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct\nInfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million\ninstructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.\nFurther analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage\nand depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work\nlays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous\nevolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to\nqualitative improvement."}

We propose three cooperative\nagents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and\nmap analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination\nAssistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation\nleg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image\nembeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to\ntrip plan disruptions.
