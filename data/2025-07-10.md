### [1] [Digital Wargames to Enhance Military Medical Evacuation Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06373)
*Jeremy Fischer,Ram Krishnamoorthy,Vishal Kumar,Mahdi Al-Husseini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEWI是一个三维多人模拟工具，用于在课堂环境中模拟医疗后送网络，提升学员的决策能力和学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏一种能够在课堂环境中模拟医疗后送网络并评估规划和决策性能的工具。

Method: 开发了基于Unity的三维多人模拟工具MEWI，模拟战场约束和不确定性，并设计了两个实战场景。

Result: MEWI显著提升了学员对医疗后送知识的学习效果和协作决策能力。

Conclusion: MEWI是医疗教育高保真培训工具的重要进步，为联合部队的医疗后送教育和操作提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Medical evacuation is one of the United States Army's most storied and
critical mission sets, responsible for efficiently and expediently evacuating
the battlefield ill and injured. Medical evacuation planning involves designing
a robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and
treating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to
simulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline
planning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the
Medical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer
simulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and
uncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty
collection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and
evacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious
island assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road
and river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as
many casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during
didactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations
of the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical
Evacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from
student participants and external observer notes to identify key planning
decision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify
general utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially
improves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative
decision-making. MEWI is a substantial step forward in the field of
high-fidelity training tools for medical education, and our study findings
offer critical insights into improving medical evacuation education and
operations across the joint force.

### [2] [Representing Prompting Patterns with PDL: Compliance Agent Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06396)
*Mandana Vaziri,Louis Mandel,Yuji Watanabe,Hirokuni Kitahara,Martin Hirzel,Anca Sailer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Declaration Language (PDL)，一种新的提示表示方法，旨在解决现有框架的复杂性和不灵活性，通过将提示置于核心位置，支持手动和自动调优，并整合LLM调用、规则代码和外部工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示工程框架要么过于复杂，要么缺乏灵活性，难以支持高级的代理编程需求。

Method: 开发了PDL，通过声明式表示抽象化组合逻辑，提升程序员效率，并支持优化。

Result: 在实际案例中，使用PDL调优提示模式的合规代理性能提升了4倍。

Conclusion: PDL通过简化提示工程和提升灵活性，显著改善了LLM应用的性能和开发效率。

Abstract: Prompt engineering for LLMs remains complex, with existing frameworks either
hiding complexity behind restrictive APIs or providing inflexible canned
patterns that resist customization -- making sophisticated agentic programming
challenging. We present the Prompt Declaration Language (PDL), a novel approach
to prompt representation that tackles this fundamental complexity by bringing
prompts to the forefront, enabling manual and automatic prompt tuning while
capturing the composition of LLM calls together with rule-based code and
external tools. By abstracting away the plumbing for such compositions, PDL
aims at improving programmer productivity while providing a declarative
representation that is amenable to optimization. This paper demonstrates PDL's
utility through a real-world case study of a compliance agent. Tuning the
prompting pattern of this agent yielded up to 4x performance improvement
compared to using a canned agent and prompt pattern.

### [3] [Jolting Technologies: Superexponential Acceleration in AI Capabilities and Implications for AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06398)
*David Orban*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了Jolting Technologies假说，提出AI能力发展可能呈现超指数增长（加速增长或正三阶导数），并通过理论框架和蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI能力发展的超指数增长模式及其潜在影响，为未来实证研究提供工具。

Method: 开发理论框架，通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证检测方法，分析缩短的创意到行动间隔和AI迭代改进的复合效应。

Result: 建立了jolt动态的数学基础，验证了检测方法，为理解AI发展轨迹及其对AGI出现的影响提供了工具。

Conclusion: 研究为未来实证研究奠定了基础，并为AI发展轨迹及其政策影响提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the Jolting Technologies Hypothesis, which posits
superexponential growth (increasing acceleration, or a positive third
derivative) in the development of AI capabilities. We develop a theoretical
framework and validate detection methodologies through Monte Carlo simulations,
while acknowledging that empirical validation awaits suitable longitudinal
data. Our analysis focuses on creating robust tools for future empirical
studies and exploring the potential implications should the hypothesis prove
valid. The study examines how factors such as shrinking idea-to-action
intervals and compounding iterative AI improvements drive this jolting pattern.
By formalizing jolt dynamics and validating detection methods through
simulation, this work provides the mathematical foundation necessary for
understanding potential AI trajectories and their consequences for AGI
emergence, offering insights for research and policy.

### [4] [Comparing Dialectical Systems: Contradiction and Counterexample in Belief Change (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06798)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文证明了q-辩证系统比p-辩证系统更强大，后者又比d-辩证系统更强，强调了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正中的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究辩证系统是为了建模代理在追求一致性时更新知识库的过程，并统一动态信念管理的可计算框架。

Method: 区分了三种辩证系统模型：d-、p-和q-辩证系统，分别基于不一致性、反例或两者进行信念修正。

Result: 证明q-辩证系统严格强于p-辩证系统，后者又强于d-辩证系统。

Conclusion: 结果突出了反例和矛盾在自动信念修正及数学推理中的互补作用。

Abstract: Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent
updating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by
Roberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working
mathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.
Dialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an
automated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief
management.
  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:
(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be
inconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding
a counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an
open problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are
strictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known
to be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights
the complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief
revision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and
research communities.

### [5] [SCC-recursiveness in infinite argumentation (extended version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06852)
*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种方法将SCC递归语义扩展到无限论证框架，并通过Baroni和Giacomin的标准评估其有效性，发现方向性在一般情况下失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SCC递归语义在无限论证框架中因缺乏良基性而失效的问题，扩展其适用性。

Method: 提出两种扩展SCC递归语义的方法，并系统评估其满足Baroni和Giacomin标准的情况。

Result: 方向性在无限框架中一般失效，但在有限框架中部分语义满足方向性。

Conclusion: 研究推动了无限论证理论的发展，为处理无界或动态领域的推理系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a foundational tool in artificial
intelligence for modeling structured reasoning and conflict. SCC-recursiveness
is a well-known design principle in which the evaluation of arguments is
decomposed according to the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the attack
graph, proceeding recursively from "higher" to "lower" components. While
SCC-recursive semantics such as \cft and \stgt have proven effective for finite
AFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to
generalize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.
  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite
setting. We systematically evaluate these semantics using Baroni and Giacomin's
established criteria, showing in particular that directionality fails in
general. We then examine these semantics' behavior in finitary frameworks,
where we find some of our semantics satisfy directionality. These results
advance the theory of infinite argumentation and lay the groundwork for
reasoning systems capable of handling unbounded or evolving domains.

### [6] [Scaling Towards the Information Boundary of Instruction Set: InfinityInstruct-Subject Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06968)
*Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统化的指令数据构建框架，通过分层标注、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和模型缺陷诊断等方法，提升指令数据的覆盖范围和深度，构建了高质量数据集InfinityInstruct-Subject。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令数据集虽规模庞大，但在复杂指令和罕见领域任务上表现不足，主要因覆盖范围和深度有限。

Method: 提出分层标注系统、种子选择算法、进化数据合成和模型缺陷诊断的闭环框架。

Result: 构建了包含约150万指令的高质量数据集，实验证明其提升模型指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为指令数据集从数量扩张到质量提升提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.
Further analyses suggest that InfinityInstruct-Subject shows enlarged coverage
and depth compared to comparable synthesized instruction datasets. Our work
lays a theoretical and practical foundation for the efficient, continuous
evolution of instruction datasets, moving from data quantity expansion to
qualitative improvement.

### [7] [The User-Centric Geo-Experience: An LLM-Powered Framework for Enhanced Planning, Navigation, and Dynamic Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06993)
*Jieren Deng,Aleksandar Cvetkovic,Pak Kiu Chung,Dragomir Yankov,Chiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态旅行规划系统，通过三个协作代理解决传统系统的不足，显著提升了查询解析、导航准确性和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统旅行规划系统静态且碎片化，无法应对现实世界的复杂性和突发变化，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 提出三个协作代理：旅行规划代理（基于网格空间和地图分析）、目的地助手代理（精细导航）和本地发现代理（利用图像嵌入和RAG应对干扰）。

Result: 系统在查询解析、导航准确性和抗干扰能力方面表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 该系统在从城市探索到应急响应等多个领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

TL;DR: FR3E是一种结构化探索框架，通过识别推理轨迹中的高不确定性决策点并提供针对性反馈，提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升LLM推理能力时存在探索不稳定的问题，需要更结构化的探索方法。

Method: 提出FR3E框架，通过高不确定性决策点识别和针对性rollout构建语义基础反馈。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，FR3E提升了训练稳定性、生成长且连贯的响应，并增加完全正确轨迹的比例。

Conclusion: FR3E通过更稳健和结构化的探索，有效提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but it struggles with unstable
exploration. We propose FR3E (First Return, Entropy-Eliciting Explore), a
structured exploration framework that identifies high-uncertainty decision
points in reasoning trajectories and performs targeted rollouts to construct
semantically grounded intermediate feedback. Our method provides targeted
guidance without relying on dense supervision. Empirical results on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks(AIME24) show that FR3E promotes more stable
training, produces longer and more coherent responses, and increases the
proportion of fully correct trajectories. These results highlight the
framework's effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning through more robust and
structured exploration.
