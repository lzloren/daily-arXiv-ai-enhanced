One effective way to\ncapture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the\nsubset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research\nbroadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible\nwithin a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a\ngiven unsatisfiable formula.\n  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named\nMUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for\nits strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for\nspecifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into\nanswer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of\nstate-of-the-art ASP systems.

To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce\nanswers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.\nUncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality\nof LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among\nthese methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown\nparticular promise, as these internal representations encode information\nrelevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this\npaper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often\nstruggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To\naddress this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with\nhidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances\nout-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most\ninformative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,\nenables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The\nexperiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features\ngenerally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain\nscenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when\nretaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic\nfeatures does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using\nthe full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some\nspecific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features\nrelative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why\nthe results are inconclusive."}

While teleoperated robotic surgery provides\nnatural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement\nlearning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through\nexploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for\nsurgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation\nLearning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and\n33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at\n10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,\ndirect video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches\nunderperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while\ndirect video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution\nmatching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over\npotentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This\nchallenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and\nprovides crucial insights for surgical AI development."}

This paper extends Pearl's approach to\ncausality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic\nprograms. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal\ninterpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by\nBochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive\nlogic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal\nreading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about\nexternal actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics\nfor stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,\nsuch as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved\neffects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a\nframework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions"}

This assumption can easily be violated due\nto unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution\nshifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and\nreliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,\nthis study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown\nselection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution\nshifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG\nreasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose\nthe Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that\nintegrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD\ngeneralization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule\nframework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD\nscenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in\neffectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark\nKGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across\ndiverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for\nreal-world applications."}

Most existing methods rely on\noverlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training\nor pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target\ndomains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles\nto learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training\nwith fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To\naddress these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model\nthat decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike\nprevious methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using\nonly content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively\nintroduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns\ncontent-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to\nfacilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric\nSimilarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through\nsimilarity computation.

Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each\ntype of strategy, conditioned on these clusters.

These\nfindings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a\npost-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for\nthe distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the\nkey property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce\na conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from\nCoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require\ncomplex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating\nthe experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad\nbehavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose\nits reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to\nstress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these\nguidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only\nwhen given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or\niterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not\ninfallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires\nactive protection and continued stress-testing."}
