PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science\nprinciple known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable\ncounterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic\ntraining data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,\nhumor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that\nlearns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.\nThis approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse\nevaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social\ncommunities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by\n46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human\njudgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and\ntransparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more\ntrustworthy, value-aware personalized applications."}

However,\ntransferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary\nenvironments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer\nmethods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly\nretraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge\ntransfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal\nrepresentations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the\nenvironment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive\nrecovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention\ninstantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect\ncorresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while\nincreasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative\nreward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]\nOur findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were\nable to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully\nretrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of\ncausal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment\ncomplexity and agents' heterogeneous goals."}

Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2).

The CPC,\nbased on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of\nevaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,\nspecificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and\nefficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random\nForest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted\ndecision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to\ncriteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a\nclassification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,\nfor evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the\nthree datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always\nperforms better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other\nclassification applications in different areas."}

We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on\ntasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question\nanswering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate\nthat there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all\ntasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some\nclosed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their\nopen-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),\nwith additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our\nexperimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are\noptimally suited for specific biomedical applications."}

The Rational Speech Act\n(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but\nexisting extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative\nscenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act\n(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn\ndialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This\ngain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA\nmodel but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a\nconversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the\ndialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and\ntemplate-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results\nshow that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative\nbehavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially\naware language agents."}

Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings."}

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools."}
