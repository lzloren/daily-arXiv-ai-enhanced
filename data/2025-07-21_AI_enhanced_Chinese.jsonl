To address these\nlimitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,\nwhich fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven\ntraffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies\nas nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution\nand dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a\nBrain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency\ngraphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,\nanalysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware\ntoken management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed\narchitecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility\nenvironments.

PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science\nprinciple known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable\ncounterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic\ntraining data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,\nhumor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that\nlearns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.\nThis approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse\nevaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social\ncommunities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by\n46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy.

However,\ntransferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary\nenvironments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer\nmethods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly\nretraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge\ntransfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal\nrepresentations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the\nenvironment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive\nrecovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention\ninstantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect\ncorresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while\nincreasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative\nreward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]\nOur findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were\nable to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully\nretrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of\ncausal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment\ncomplexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5171\u4eab\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMARL\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u78b0\u649e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b8f\uff08macro\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u5728\u7ebf\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u586b\u8865\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b(2) \u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e3aMARL\u5728\u975e\u9759\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results.

We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and\nfine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.\nResults show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the\ndominant language token yields the best transcription performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3001\u62fc\u63a5\u5355\u8bed\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u52a0\u6cf0\u7f57\u5c3c\u4e9a\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\uff08CS\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5408\u6210CS\u6570\u636e\u3001\u62fc\u63a5\u5355\u8bed\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9eCS\u6570\u636e\u52a0\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eWhisper\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u5408\u6210CS\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e3b\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347CS-ASR\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u793e\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs.

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLABA track\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u901a\u4fd7\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7PLABA track\uff082023-2024\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5168\u6587\u6539\u5199\u548c\u672f\u8bed\u66ff\u6362\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u4e1a\u53c2\u8003\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u901a\u4fd7\u5316\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
