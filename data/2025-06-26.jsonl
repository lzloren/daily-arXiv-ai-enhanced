Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g.

Much of this\nknowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To\nactivate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has\nbegun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom\nLLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking\nalgorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose\nupdates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences\ndesigning and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using\nRAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for\nvarious LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the\nArgonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses\ncan enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial\nfocus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible\nframework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable\nsupport, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and\ndevelopment. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into\na robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate\nscientific discovery."}

However, existing agents typically operate\nin isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader\nresearch community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute\nby sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live\nevaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with\nand leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community.\nBuilding on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at\nexchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.\nCoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2%\nhuman competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions.

This will require new reasoning\nskills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason\nabout the \"mental\" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent\nabilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from\nnarrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus\npropose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM\ndrawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in\nall other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other\nbenchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing\ninteractive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nof frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We\nfind that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple\nword-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive\nscience experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.\nSurprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly\nworse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that\nDecrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and\npaves the path towards better artificial agents."}
