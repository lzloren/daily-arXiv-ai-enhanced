Building a trusted ecosystem\nis therefore essential -- it helps people embrace AI with confidence and gives\nmaximal space for innovation while avoiding backlash.\n  The \"2025 Singapore Conference on AI (SCAI): International Scientific\nExchange on AI Safety\" aimed to support research in this space by bringing\ntogether AI scientists across geographies to identify and synthesise research\npriorities in AI safety. This resulting report builds on the International AI\nSafety Report chaired by Yoshua Bengio and backed by 33 governments. By\nadopting a defence-in-depth model, this report organises AI safety research\ndomains into three types: challenges with creating trustworthy AI systems\n(Development), challenges with evaluating their risks (Assessment), and\nchallenges with monitoring and intervening after deployment (Control)."}

And, if instructed, do these systems\npreserve inference time user privacy in non-adversarial multi-turn\nconversation. Existing benchmarks to evaluate contextual privacy in LLM-agents\nprimarily assess single-turn, low-complexity tasks where private information\ncan be easily excluded. We first present a benchmark - MAGPIE comprising 158\nreal-life high-stakes scenarios across 15 domains. These scenarios are designed\nsuch that complete exclusion of private data impedes task completion yet\nunrestricted information sharing could lead to substantial losses. We then\nevaluate the current state-of-the-art LLMs on (a) their understanding of\ncontextually private data and (b) their ability to collaborate without\nviolating user privacy. Empirical experiments demonstrate that current models,\nincluding GPT-4o and Claude-2.7-Sonnet, lack robust understanding of contextual\nprivacy, misclassifying private data as shareable 25.2\\% and 43.6\\% of the\ntime. In multi-turn conversations, these models disclose private information in\n59.9\\% and 50.5\\% of cases even under explicit privacy instructions.\nFurthermore, multi-agent systems fail to complete tasks in 71\\% of scenarios.\nThese results underscore that current models are not aligned towards both\ncontextual privacy preservation and collaborative task-solving."}

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that\nincorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal\nreasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly\nenhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and\ncounterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to\nadvance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making\nstrides towards level-2."}

Building on earlier work, we\ncontend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three\nfundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap\n-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning\ndemands internal representations that support simulation of actions and\nresponse, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and\ncontinuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific\ndiscovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in\ncausal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic\nplanners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge\ngraphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes\ncausal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while\nstrengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations\nthrough closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and\nautomated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides\naction and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an\narchitecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models\nthat enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds\nhypotheses in reality.

To address these challenges, we propose\nTableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture\nspecifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table\ndata. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which\npredicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)\nand dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,\nTable-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed\nby symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven\npretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of\n1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and\nindustry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining.
