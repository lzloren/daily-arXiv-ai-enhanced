Despite this advancement,\ncurrent AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive\nnature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or\nincorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is\nmost apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain\nunderdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring\nsystems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured,\nindividualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel\nmulti-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized\nfeedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to\nenable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students\nto learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise\nfor exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized\nexercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in\neducation by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical\nagents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and\neffective systems for teaching mathematics."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a\nprincipled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical\nreasoning."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length\ngeneralization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various\ntasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.\nThe experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,\ninstead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length\ngeneralization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors\nconsistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.\nThis work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of\nLLM reasoning from synthetic data."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use."}
