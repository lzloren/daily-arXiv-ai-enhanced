To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment.

Healthcare is one of such domains\nwhere KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge\naccuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing\ngeneral factual information often lack the ability to account for important\ncontexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are\ncrucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)\nprovide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which\nprovide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a\nframework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate\ncontextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.\nUsing advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from\ngeneral KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph\nmodel to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,\nwe employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to\njointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,\nfully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In\nexperiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG\ndemonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across\nmultiple evaluation metrics.

However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism. We also\nprove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of\nincreased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for\nrecent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following\ntrade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through\nperturbation experiments in multi-reward RL.

Each\nessay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores\ncorresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.\nResults indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores\noverall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,\nparticularly for story narration tasks.

However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites.

Despite advances\nin language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs\nperform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for\nagents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this\ngap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure\nspatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our\nmethodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of\nvarying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate\nfeedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test\nfundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across\nidentical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic\ntransfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while\nOpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$,\nother models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100%\nof failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a\ncell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in\nIcelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,\nsuggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather\nthan language-agnostic mechanisms.

The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of\nmodern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,\nespecially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,\nmulti-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world\napplications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual\naccuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,\nmulti-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over\ncompleteness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for\nefficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways\ngeneration and a post-hoc verification.

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones.

To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO).

This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable\nknowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.\nMoreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct\npreference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection\nbetween forgetting and retained knowledge.

GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across\nall prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a\nCHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint\nmulti-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over\n10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than\n1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a\npractical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing\nthat high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited\nresources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65b9\u8a00\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\uff08DA\uff09\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\uff08MSA\uff09\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b9\u8a00\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "GPT-4o\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u91cf\u5316Gemma2-9B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672cGPT-4o\uff0c\u591a\u65b9\u8a00\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534710%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684DA-MSA\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u4e3a\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bedNLP\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels.

With\nthe emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text\nembeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce\nrich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically\nleverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized\nthrough contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,\nwe provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the\nroles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental\narchitecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding\nextraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,\nand data construction.

Analysis of\nthese reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to\nidentify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics\n(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\\leq$\n18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process\nbased entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully\nautomated, open source \"text-to-table\" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)\ncould reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide\nPFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script\nruntime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one\nthat can be completed in minutes.

In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets.

SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance.

We explore the\ndiversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to\nfurther understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that\nDPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,\nwe present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an\ninstruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output\ndiversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and\neven maintains or improves quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u521b\u610f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6062\u590d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8c03\u4f18\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cconformative decoding\u201d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and\ncostly, the emerging \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigm sheds light on a promising\napproach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,\nto date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona\ndescriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are\nnot generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose\nMAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically\nconstruct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant\ntext documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the\npersonas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate\nmulti-dimensional feedback.
