However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include\nsubstantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention\nscores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater\nattention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing\nthis redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance\nthrough clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we\nsystematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention\nscores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit\ninstruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore,\nwe propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in\nlow-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting\nredundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then\nresume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly\nimproves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any\ntraining involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on\nchallenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where\nreasoning redundancy is more prevalent."}

However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating\ncausal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves\nfaster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the\ntrained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for\nanomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor\nplacement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current\nimplementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various\nreinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world\ncausality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications."}

FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results\ntherefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.\nFrom prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward\nenvironments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?"}

In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics,\ncognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and\ncomparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified\nthe main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies,\nand insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should\nspecifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to\nillustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study\nguidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's\nability to parse the rapidly growing field.

A key contribution of\nour work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward\nto incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for\ninstance analysis in the CVRP field."}

This principle forms the basis of transfer learning,\nwhere large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream\ntasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of\ntask adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where,\ndue to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational\nmodels is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational\nimmunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our\nwork focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of\npriors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on\nnon-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that\nour hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire\nmore generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model\nAgnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene\ngeneration, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a\nhandful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We\nthen extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel\nscenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed\nscenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a\npre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction,\naddressing critical challenges in computational immunology"}
