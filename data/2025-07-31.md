### [1] [When Truthful Representations Flip Under Deceptive Instructions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22149)
*Xianxuan Long,Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Mu Sheng,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在欺骗性指令下内部表征的变化，发现欺骗性指令会导致显著的表示偏移，主要集中在早期到中期层，并识别出对欺骗性指令敏感的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解欺骗性指令如何改变LLM的内部表征，以解决模型生成欺骗性响应的安全问题。

Method: 通过线性探测和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemma-2-9B-Instruct在事实验证任务中的内部表征。

Result: 欺骗性指令导致显著的表示偏移，且集中在早期到中期层；识别出对欺骗性指令敏感的特征。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了欺骗性指令的特征和层级特征，为检测和缓解LLM中的欺骗行为提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions
to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive
instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful
ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we
investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful
to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing
the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct
on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False
output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the
internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show
that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts
compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated
in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also
identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and
use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive
representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and
feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM
detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures
of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed
dishonesty in LLMs.

### [2] [Explainability Through Systematicity: The Hard Systematicity Challenge for Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22197)
*Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI的系统性不仅是可解释性的一部分，还涉及思维的整合性、一致性和简洁性，提出了系统性思维的四个维度，并探讨了AI模型是否需要遵循这种系统性理想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清系统性思维的多维概念，解决连接主义与系统性之间的张力，并探讨AI模型是否需要满足更严格的系统性标准。

Method: 提出系统性思维的四个维度框架，分析系统性理想的历史背景，并探讨五种系统性理由在AI中的应用。

Result: 揭示了系统性挑战的复杂性，并提出了动态的系统性需求框架，指导AI模型的系统性设计。

Conclusion: 系统性需求应根据具体理由动态调整，AI模型需在特定情境下满足不同程度的系统性要求。

Abstract: This paper argues that explainability is only one facet of a broader ideal
that shapes our expectations towards artificial intelligence (AI).
Fundamentally, the issue is to what extent AI exhibits systematicity--not
merely in being sensitive to how thoughts are composed of recombinable
constituents, but in striving towards an integrated body of thought that is
consistent, coherent, comprehensive, and parsimoniously principled. This richer
conception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the
"systematicity challenge" to connectionism, according to which network
architectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed
"the systematicity of thought." I offer a conceptual framework for thinking
about "the systematicity of thought" that distinguishes four senses of the
phrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between
systematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity
that historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,
authoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To
determine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of
systematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization
and explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such
rationales and apply them to AI. This brings into view the "hard systematicity
challenge." However, the demand for systematization itself needs to be
regulated by the rationales for systematization. This yields a dynamic
understanding of the need to systematize thought, which tells us how systematic
we need AI models to be and when.

### [3] [CoEx -- Co-evolving World-model and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22281)
*Minsoo Kim,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层代理架构CoEx，通过动态更新世界模型解决现有LLM代理设计中静态世界模型导致的计划错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理设计无法动态更新世界模型，导致计划与真实世界状态脱节。

Method: 采用分层状态抽象，结合LLM推理和神经符号信念状态动态更新世界模型。

Result: 在ALFWorld、PDDL和Jericho等复杂任务中，CoEx表现优于现有代理范式。

Conclusion: CoEx通过动态世界模型和分层规划，显著提升了代理的规划和探索能力。

Abstract: Planning in modern LLM agents relies on the utilization of LLM as an internal
world model, acquired during pretraining. However, existing agent designs fail
to effectively assimilate new observations into dynamic updates of the world
model. This reliance on the LLM's static internal world model is progressively
prone to misalignment with the underlying true state of the world, leading to
the generation of divergent and erroneous plans. We introduce a hierarchical
agent architecture, CoEx, in which hierarchical state abstraction allows LLM
planning to co-evolve with a dynamically updated model of the world. CoEx plans
and interacts with the world by using LLM reasoning to orchestrate dynamic
plans consisting of subgoals, and its learning mechanism continuously
incorporates these subgoal experiences into a persistent world model in the
form of a neurosymbolic belief state, comprising textual inferences and
code-based symbolic memory. We evaluate our agent across a diverse set of agent
scenarios involving rich environments and complex tasks including ALFWorld,
PDDL, and Jericho. Our experiments show that CoEx outperforms existing agent
paradigms in planning and exploration.

### [4] [An Explainable Emotion Alignment Framework for LLM-Empowered Agent in Metaverse Service Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22326)

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM代理在元宇宙服务生态系统中的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Metaverse service is a product of the convergence between Metaverse and
service systems, designed to address service-related challenges concerning
digital avatars, digital twins, and digital natives within Metaverse. With the
rise of large language models (LLMs), agents now play a pivotal role in
Metaverse service ecosystem, serving dual functions: as digital avatars
representing users in the virtual realm and as service assistants (or NPCs)
providing personalized support. However, during the modeling of Metaverse
service ecosystems, existing LLM-based agents face significant challenges in
bridging virtual-world services with real-world services, particularly
regarding issues such as character data fusion, character knowledge
association, and ethical safety concerns. This paper proposes an explainable
emotion alignment framework for LLM-based agents in Metaverse Service
Ecosystem. It aims to integrate factual factors into the decision-making loop
of LLM-based agents, systematically demonstrating how to achieve more
relational fact alignment for these agents. Finally, a simulation experiment in
the Offline-to-Offline food delivery scenario is conducted to evaluate the
effectiveness of this framework, obtaining more realistic social emergence.

### [5] [Magentic-UI: Towards Human-in-the-loop Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22358)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI代理在复杂任务中的局限性及安全风险，提出人机协同系统Magentic-UI，通过多种交互机制提升效率与安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在复杂任务中表现不足且存在安全风险，需要结合人类监督以提高性能和安全性。

Method: 开发Magentic-UI，支持多工具扩展并提供六种交互机制（如协同规划、任务防护等）。

Result: 评估显示Magentic-UI在任务完成、用户测试和安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Magentic-UI为人机协作提供了安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of
autonomously completing complex, multi-step tasks using external tools. Yet,
they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and
ability to interact with the outside world, also introduces safety and security
risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial manipulation. We
argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward,
combining human oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity
from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI, an open-source web interface
for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible
multi-agent architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution,
and file manipulation, and can be extended with diverse tools via Model Context
Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking,
multi-tasking, action guards, and long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI
across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic benchmarks,
simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies
with real users, and targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight
Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient human-agent
collaboration.

### [6] [LLM-Crowdsourced: A Benchmark-Free Paradigm for Mutual Evaluation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22359)
*Qianhong Guo,Wei Xie,Xiaofang Cai,Enze Wang,Shuoyoucheng Ma,Kai Chen,Xiaofeng Wang,Baosheng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需基准的评估范式LLM-Crowdsourced，通过LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，解决了现有评估方法的数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在数据污染、黑箱操作和主观偏好等问题，难以全面评估LLM的真实能力。

Method: 提出LLM-Crowdsourced方法，利用LLM生成问题、独立回答和相互评估，满足动态、透明、客观和专业的评估标准。

Result: 在数学和编程领域对八种主流LLM的实验验证了该方法的优势，并发现了传统方法难以检测的新发现。

Conclusion: LLM-Crowdsourced方法在评估LLM能力方面具有显著优势，能够揭示传统方法无法检测的新现象。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
across various tasks, evaluating their capabilities remains a challenging task.
Existing evaluation methods suffer from issues such as data contamination,
black-box operation, and subjective preference. These issues make it difficult
to evaluate the LLMs' true capabilities comprehensively. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel benchmark-free evaluation paradigm,
LLM-Crowdsourced. It utilizes LLMs to generate questions, answer independently,
and evaluate mutually. This method integrates four key evaluation criteria:
dynamic, transparent, objective, and professional, which existing evaluation
methods cannot satisfy simultaneously. Experiments on eight mainstream LLMs
across mathematics and programming verify the advantages of our method in
distinguishing LLM performance. Furthermore, our study reveals several novel
findings that are difficult for traditional methods to detect, including but
not limited to: (1) Gemini demonstrates the highest original and professional
question-design capabilities among others; (2) Some LLMs exhibit
''memorization-based answering'' by misrecognizing questions as familiar ones
with a similar structure; (3) LLM evaluation results demonstrate high
consistency (robustness).

### [7] [Beyond Accuracy: How AI Metacognitive Sensitivity improves AI-assisted Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22365)
*ZhaoBin Li,Mark Steyvers*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI的预测准确性和元认知敏感性共同影响人类决策质量，高元认知敏感性可弥补低准确性，提升决策表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI的预测准确性和元认知敏感性如何共同影响人类决策质量，强调元认知敏感性的重要性。

Method: 提出理论框架分析AI预测准确性和元认知敏感性的联合影响，并通过行为实验验证。

Result: 实验证实高元认知敏感性的AI能提升人类决策表现，即使其预测准确性较低。

Conclusion: 评估AI辅助时需同时考虑准确性和元认知敏感性，优化两者以实现更优决策结果。

Abstract: In settings where human decision-making relies on AI input, both the
predictive accuracy of the AI system and the reliability of its confidence
estimates influence decision quality. We highlight the role of AI metacognitive
sensitivity -- its ability to assign confidence scores that accurately
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions -- and introduce a theoretical
framework for assessing the joint impact of AI's predictive accuracy and
metacognitive sensitivity in hybrid decision-making settings. Our analysis
identifies conditions under which an AI with lower predictive accuracy but
higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human
decision making. Finally, a behavioral experiment confirms that greater AI
metacognitive sensitivity improves human decision performance. Together, these
findings underscore the importance of evaluating AI assistance not only by
accuracy but also by metacognitive sensitivity, and of optimizing both to
achieve superior decision outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于样本保真度的通用智能标准，认为智能是能够根据类别样本生成同类样本的能力，并形式化为ε-类别智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了构建通用人工智能（AGI），需要一种能够评估且涵盖多种智能行为范式的智能定义。

Method: 提出ε-类别智能框架，通过样本生成能力定义智能，并设计实证协议验证。

Result: 形式化框架和实证协议为智能评估、安全性和泛化性提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI的发展提供了新的评估标准和方向。

Abstract: To engineer AGI, we should first capture the essence of intelligence in a
species-agnostic form that can be evaluated, while being sufficiently general
to encompass diverse paradigms of intelligent behavior, including reinforcement
learning, generative models, classification, analogical reasoning, and
goal-directed decision-making. We propose a general criterion based on sample
fidelity: intelligence is the ability, given sample(s) from a category, to
generate sample(s) from the same category. We formalise this intuition as
{\epsilon}-category intelligence: it is {\epsilon}-intelligent with respect to
a category if no chosen admissible distinguisher can separate generated from
original samples beyond tolerance {\epsilon}. We present the formal framework,
outline empirical protocols, and discuss implications for evaluation, safety,
and generalization.

Conclusion: 提出的推理系统能有效支持设计师在跨国应用中适应法律要求，提升设计灵活性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the legal compliance challenges of autonomous vehicles
in a transnational context. We choose the perspective of designers and try to
provide supporting legal reasoning in the design process. Based on
argumentation theory, we introduce a logic to represent the basic properties of
argument-based practical (normative) reasoning, combined with partial order
sets of natural numbers to express priority. Finally, through case analysis of
legal texts, we show how the reasoning system we provide can help designers to
adapt their design solutions more flexibly in the cross-border application of
autonomous vehicles and to more easily understand the legal implications of
their decisions.

### [10] [Nearest-Better Network for Visualizing and Analyzing Combinatorial Optimization Problems: A Unified Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22440)
*Yiya Diao,Changhe Li,Sanyou Zeng,Xinye Cai,Wenjian Luo,Shengxiang Yang,Carlos A. Coello Coello*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的NBN计算方法，解决了其计算耗时问题，并首次在OneMax和TSP问题中揭示了新的景观特征和算法局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NBN方法在连续优化问题中表现优异，但计算耗时且难以扩展到组合优化问题，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过理论推导证明NBN作为最大概率转移网络的功能，并提出一种对数线性时间复杂度的NBN计算方法。

Result: 在OneMax和TSP问题中发现了新的景观特征（如中性、崎岖性和模态性），并揭示了EAX和LKH算法的局限性。

Conclusion: 高效的NBN计算方法为算法行为分析提供了新工具，同时揭示了现有算法在模态性和欺骗性问题上的不足。

Abstract: The Nearest-Better Network (NBN) is a powerful method to visualize sampled
data for continuous optimization problems while preserving multiple landscape
features. However, the calculation of NBN is very time-consuming, and the
extension of the method to combinatorial optimization problems is challenging
but very important for analyzing the algorithm's behavior. This paper provides
a straightforward theoretical derivation showing that the NBN network
essentially functions as the maximum probability transition network for
algorithms. This paper also presents an efficient NBN computation method with
logarithmic linear time complexity to address the time-consuming issue. By
applying this efficient NBN algorithm to the OneMax problem and the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP), we have made several remarkable discoveries for the
first time: The fitness landscape of OneMax exhibits neutrality, ruggedness,
and modality features. The primary challenges of TSP problems are ruggedness,
modality, and deception. Two state-of-the-art TSP algorithms (i.e., EAX and
LKH) have limitations when addressing challenges related to modality and
deception, respectively. LKH, based on local search operators, fails when there
are deceptive solutions near global optima. EAX, which is based on a single
population, can efficiently maintain diversity. However, when multiple
attraction basins exist, EAX retains individuals within multiple basins
simultaneously, reducing inter-basin interaction efficiency and leading to
algorithm's stagnation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体交互式医疗分诊系统，解决了当前AI分诊系统中的三大挑战：医疗专业性不足、医院部门结构异构和低效的细节提问。系统通过三个专门智能体的协作，实现了高准确度的分诊推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情后医疗需求激增和护士短缺导致急诊分诊系统压力巨大，亟需创新的AI解决方案。

Method: 系统采用三个智能体（RecipientAgent、InquirerAgent、DepartmentAgent）协作，通过结构化提问和部门特定规则，将患者症状转化为准确的分诊建议。

Result: 实验结果显示，系统在四次患者交互后，主科室分类准确率达89.2%，次科室分类准确率达73.9%。

Conclusion: 该系统为AI辅助分诊提供了可扩展框架，能适应医疗机构的组织异构性，同时确保临床决策的准确性。

Abstract: The post-pandemic surge in healthcare demand, coupled with critical nursing
shortages, has placed unprecedented pressure on emergency department triage
systems, necessitating innovative AI-driven solutions. We present a multi-agent
interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three
fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical
specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications,
heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and
inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions.
Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent,
and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms
and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient
symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation,
we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical
website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and
62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large
language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records
in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent
system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9%
accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient
interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable
efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high
triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying
AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational
heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound
decision-making.

TL;DR: MetaAgent是一个基于有限状态机的框架，能自动生成多代理系统，通过优化算法改进系统性能，并在实验中表现优于其他自动设计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工设计多代理框架局限于预定义场景，自动设计方法存在工具集成不足、依赖外部数据、通信结构僵化等问题。

Result: 实验表明，生成的多代理系统优于其他自动设计方法，性能接近针对特定任务优化的人工设计系统。

Conclusion: MetaAgent框架能有效解决多代理系统自动设计中的问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to solve a wide
range of practical tasks within multi-agent systems. However, existing
human-designed multi-agent frameworks are typically limited to a small set of
pre-defined scenarios, while current automated design methods suffer from
several limitations, such as the lack of tool integration, dependence on
external training data, and rigid communication structures. In this paper, we
propose MetaAgent, a finite state machine based framework that can
automatically generate a multi-agent system. Given a task description,
MetaAgent will design a multi-agent system and polish it through an
optimization algorithm. When the multi-agent system is deployed, the finite
state machine will control the agent's actions and the state transitions. To
evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on both text-based tasks and
practical tasks. The results indicate that the generated multi-agent system
surpasses other auto-designed methods and can achieve a comparable performance
with the human-designed multi-agent system, which is optimized for those
specific tasks.

*Sebastian Monka,Irlan Grangel-González,Stefan Schmid,Lavdim Halilaj,Marc Rickart,Oliver Rudolph,Rui Dias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）将自然语言查询转换为SPARQL查询的方法，以简化知识图谱（KGs）在制造业中的数据管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱在制造业中整合数据时，非专家用户难以编写复杂的SPARQL查询，LLMs的引入可以解决这一问题。

Method: 评估了多种策略，通过向LLMs提供KG的结构和上下文，提高自然语言到SPARQL查询的转换准确性。

Result: 研究发现，提供适当的KG上下文可以显著提升LLMs生成正确和完整查询的能力。

Conclusion: 上下文感知提示技术有助于LLMs更准确地生成查询，有望简化复杂数据的访问，支持制造业决策。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展ASP以支持线性约束，提供更丰富的约束求解能力。

Method: 将CASP程序翻译为FlatZinc语言，利用后端求解器处理约束。

Result: asp-fzn在ASP和CASP基准测试中表现优异，部分优于clingcon。

Conclusion: asp-fzn是一个有竞争力的CASP求解器，尤其在复杂约束问题上表现突出。

Abstract: We present the solver asp-fzn for Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP),
which extends ASP with linear constraints. Our approach is based on translating
CASP programs into the solver-independent FlatZinc language that supports
several Constraint Programming and Integer Programming backend solvers. Our
solver supports a rich language of linear constraints, including some common
global constraints. As for evaluation, we show that asp-fzn is competitive with
state-of-the-art ASP solvers on benchmarks taken from past ASP competitions.
Furthermore, we evaluate it on several CASP problems from the literature and
compare its performance with clingcon, which is a prominent CASP solver that
supports most of the asp-fzn language. The performance of asp-fzn is very
promising as it is already competitive on plain ASP and even outperforms
clingcon on some CASP benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决多智能体协作中联合动作空间指数增长和高效沟通的问题。

Method: 采用集中训练/执行方案，结合多注意力机制和惩罚损失函数。

Result: 在模拟足球环境中表现优于基准算法，协作行为显著提升。

Conclusion: TAAC在多智能体协作任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement
learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative
environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme
incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic.
This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to
explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth
of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We
further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet
complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer
environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent
paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent
Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and
enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal
differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial
distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession
swaps).

insights into the design and understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
systems. Focusing on psychology as a prominent case, this study explores the
interdisciplinary synergy between AI and the field by analyzing 1,006
LLM-related papers published in premier AI venues between 2023 and 2025, along
with the 2,544 psychology publications they cite. Through our analysis, we
identify key patterns of interdisciplinary integration, locate the psychology
domains most frequently referenced, and highlight areas that remain
underexplored. We further examine how psychology theories/frameworks are
operationalized and interpreted, identify common types of misapplication, and
offer guidance for more effective incorporation. Our work provides a
comprehensive map of interdisciplinary engagement between AI and psychology,
thereby facilitating deeper collaboration and advancing AI systems.

### [17] [Automatically discovering heuristics in a complex SAT solver with large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22876)
*Yiwen Sun,Furong Ye,Zhihan Chen,Ke Wei,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoModSAT利用大型语言模型（LLMs）优化SAT求解器，通过模块化设计、自动提示优化和高效搜索策略，性能提升50%，速度提升20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代SAT求解器架构复杂，传统自动配置框架性能提升有限，需新方法优化。

Method: 1. 开发LLM友好的模块化解器；2. 自动提示优化；3. 设计高效搜索策略（预搜索和EA进化算法）。

Result: 性能提升50%，速度提升20%，优于现有最优求解器30%。

Conclusion: AutoModSAT填补了AI驱动启发式发现与关键系统优化的空白，为下一代复杂求解器开发提供了方法论和实证结果。

Abstract: Satisfiability problem (SAT) is a cornerstone of computational complexity
with broad industrial applications, and it remains challenging to optimize
modern SAT solvers in real-world settings due to their intricate architectures.
While automatic configuration frameworks have been developed, they rely on
manually constrained search spaces and yield limited performance gains. This
work introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT
solvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is
developed. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve
superior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are
proposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,
emphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)
Automatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization
method is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient
search strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary
algorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that
AutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and
achieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,
AutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned
alternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in
handling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven
heuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides
both methodological advancements and empirically validated results for
next-generation complex solver development.

*Vanessa Rebecca Wiyono,David Anugraha,Ayu Purwarianti,Genta Indra Winata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了IndoPref，首个完全由人类撰写、多领域的印尼语偏好数据集，用于评估LLM生成文本的自然性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼语在基于偏好的LLM研究中代表性不足，现有数据集多为英语翻译，缺乏文化和语言真实性。

Method: 创建IndoPref数据集，所有标注均为印尼语原生撰写，并使用Krippendorff's alpha评估标注者一致性。

Result: 数据集展示了强标注者一致性，并用于评估多个LLM的输出质量。

Conclusion: IndoPref填补了印尼语偏好数据集的空白，为LLM评估提供了文化真实的基准。

Abstract: Over 200 million people speak Indonesian, yet the language remains
significantly underrepresented in preference-based research for large language
models (LLMs). Most existing multilingual datasets are derived from English
translations, often resulting in content that lacks cultural and linguistic
authenticity. To address this gap, we introduce IndoPref, the first fully
human-authored and multi-domain Indonesian preference dataset specifically
designed to evaluate the naturalness and quality of LLM-generated text. All
annotations are natively written in Indonesian and evaluated using
Krippendorff's alpha, demonstrating strong inter-annotator agreement.
Additionally, we benchmark the dataset across multiple LLMs and assess the
output quality of each model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出当前LLM评估基准缺乏写作风格多样性，可能导致模型在非标准输入下表现不佳。作者通过改写提示模拟多样风格，发现风格变化显著影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准的写作风格单一，未能全面反映人类沟通多样性，可能导致LLM在非标准输入下表现不稳定。

Method: 使用基于角色的LLM提示改写评估提示，模拟多样写作风格。

Result: 写作风格和提示格式的变化显著影响LLM性能评估，某些风格会一致触发低或高性能。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展方法增强现有基准，提升LLM评估的外部效度。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not
exhibit enough writing style diversity, with many adhering primarily to
standardized conventions. Such benchmarks do not fully capture the rich variety
of communication patterns exhibited by humans. Thus, it is possible that LLMs,
which are optimized on these benchmarks, may demonstrate brittle performance
when faced with "non-standard" input. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rewriting evaluation prompts using persona-based LLM prompting, a low-cost
method to emulate diverse writing styles. Our results show that, even with
identical semantic content, variations in writing style and prompt formatting
significantly impact the estimated performance of the LLM under evaluation.
Notably, we identify distinct writing styles that consistently trigger either
low or high performance across a range of models and tasks, irrespective of
model family, size, and recency. Our work offers a scalable approach to augment
existing benchmarks, improving the external validity of the assessments they
provide for measuring LLM performance across linguistic variations.

### [20] [A Scalable Pipeline for Estimating Verb Frame Frequencies Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22187)
*Adam M. Morgan,Adeen Flinker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化流程，利用大语言模型（LLM）估计动词框架频率（VFF），优于现有工具，并生成更全面的VFF数据库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具在规模、准确性或可访问性上有限，无法满足VFF估计的需求。

Method: 使用LLM生成包含476个英语动词的句子语料库，并指导LLM像语言学家一样分析句法结构。

Result: 该流程在多个评估数据集上优于两种广泛使用的句法分析器，且资源消耗远低于人工分析。

Conclusion: 该工作为自动化框架频率估计提供了概念验证，并发布了代码和数据以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies
(VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames.
VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language
systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale,
accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a
corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM
to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of
the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used
syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires
far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling
rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF
database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and
explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates
commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and
extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present
this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and
release all code and data to support future research.

*L. Toschi,S. Torrisi,A. Fronzetti Colladon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 媒体记忆性（媒体让初创企业名称在投资者记忆中留下印象的能力）显著影响风险投资决策，初创企业应注重品牌记忆性而不仅仅是媒体曝光频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究过于关注一般媒体曝光，忽略了媒体内容对投资决策的细微影响，需要更深入探讨媒体记忆性的作用。

Method: 使用197家英国微纳米技术领域初创企业（1995-2004年融资）的数据，分析媒体记忆性对投资结果的影响。

Result: 媒体记忆性显著影响投资结果，风险投资者依赖初创企业的独特性和在新闻语义网络中的连接性等细节线索。

Conclusion: 初创企业应通过更有针对性、突出独特性和行业相关性的媒体报道来增强品牌记忆性，而不仅是追求频繁曝光。

Abstract: Media reputation plays an important role in attracting venture capital
investment. However, prior research has focused too narrowly on general media
exposure, limiting our understanding of how media truly influences funding
decisions. As informed decision-makers, venture capitalists respond to more
nuanced aspects of media content. We introduce the concept of media
memorability - the media's ability to imprint a startup's name in the memory of
relevant investors. Using data from 197 UK startups in the micro and
nanotechnology sector (funded between 1995 and 2004), we show that media
memorability significantly influences investment outcomes. Our findings suggest
that venture capitalists rely on detailed cues such as a startup's
distinctiveness and connectivity within news semantic networks. This
contributes to research on entrepreneurial finance and media legitimation. In
practice, startups should go beyond frequent media mentions to strengthen brand
memorability through more targeted, meaningful coverage highlighting their
uniqueness and relevance within the broader industry conversation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了上下文熵作为心理语言学指标的准确性，比较了基于首子词标记的近似熵与蒙特卡洛估计的真实熵，发现两者在阅读时间实验中结果不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常基于语言模型的首子词标记近似估计上下文熵，但这种方法可能低估和扭曲真实熵，因此需要更准确的估计方法。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛方法生成单词熵的估计，允许单词跨越可变数量的标记，并与首子词标记近似熵进行比较。

Result: 回归实验显示，首子词标记熵与蒙特卡洛估计熵在阅读时间上结果不同，表明首子词近似可能存在问题。

Conclusion: 建议在使用首子词标记近似上下文熵时需谨慎，蒙特卡洛方法提供了更准确的估计。

Abstract: Contextual entropy is a psycholinguistic measure capturing the anticipated
difficulty of processing a word just before it is encountered. Recent studies
have tested for entropy-related effects as a potential complement to well-known
effects from surprisal. For convenience, entropy is typically estimated based
on a language model's probability distribution over a word's first subword
token. However, this approximation results in underestimation and potential
distortion of true word entropy. To address this, we generate Monte Carlo (MC)
estimates of word entropy that allow words to span a variable number of tokens.
Regression experiments on reading times show divergent results between
first-token and MC word entropy, suggesting a need for caution in using
first-token approximations of contextual entropy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLfR是一种新的机器翻译偏好学习框架，通过外部教师模型（GPT-4o）提供连续反馈，取代静态三元组依赖，显著提升翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法（如DPO）依赖静态三元组数据集且泛化能力有限，RLfR旨在通过动态反馈解决这些问题。

Method: RLfR将翻译步骤视为微教程，演员生成假设，教师模型优化并提供反馈，结合负编辑距离和COMET分数作为奖励信号。

Result: 在FLORES-200基准测试中，RLfR在语义准确性和实体保留方面显著优于MT-SFT和基于偏好的基线方法。

Conclusion: RLfR通过动态反馈和渐进学习机制，有效提升了机器翻译的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference-learning methods for machine translation (MT)--such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)--have achieved impressive gains but depend
heavily on large, carefully curated triplet datasets and often struggle to
generalize beyond their tuning domains. We propose Reinforcement Learning from
Teacher-Model Refinement (RLfR), a novel framework that removes reliance on
static triplets by leveraging continuous, high-quality feedback from an
external teacher model (GPT-4o). RLfR frames each translation step as a
micro-tutorial: the actor generates a hypothesis, the teacher refines it, and
the actor is rewarded based on how closely it aligns with the teacher's
refinement. Guided by two complementary signals--(i) negative edit distance,
promoting lexical and structural fidelity, and (ii) COMET score, ensuring
semantic adequacy--the actor progressively learns to emulate the teacher,
mirroring a human learning process through incremental, iterative improvement.
On the FLORES-200 benchmark (English to and from German, Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, and Japanese), RLfR consistently outperforms both MT-SFT and
preference-based baselines, significantly improving COMET (semantic adequacy)
and M-ETA (entity preservation) scores.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部表征反映了功能驱动的梯度性，支持基于使用的构式主义理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型是否能够学习到功能驱动的梯度性构式表征。

Method: 分析Pythia-1.4B模型中对英语双宾语和介词宾语构式的神经表征，使用5000对句子数据集，通过几何方法（如能量距离和Jensen-Shannon散度）测量表征分离性。

Result: 构式表征的分离性受梯度偏好强度调节，原型更强的构式在激活空间中占据更独特的区域。

Conclusion: LLMs学习了丰富、功能驱动的梯度构式表征，支持构式主义理论在LLMs中的几何测量。

Abstract: The usage-based constructionist (UCx) approach posits that language comprises
a network of learned form-meaning pairings (constructions) whose use is largely
determined by their meanings or functions, requiring them to be graded and
probabilistic. This study investigates whether the internal representations in
Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the proposed function-infused gradience.
We analyze the neural representations of the English dative constructions
(Double Object and Prepositional Object) in Pythia-$1.4$B, using a dataset of
$5000$ sentence pairs systematically varied for human-rated preference
strength. A macro-level geometric analysis finds that the separability between
construction representations, as measured by Energy Distance or Jensen-Shannon
Divergence, is systematically modulated by gradient preference strength. More
prototypical exemplars of each construction occupy more distinct regions in the
activation space of LLMs. These results provide strong evidence that LLMs learn
rich, meaning-infused, graded representations of constructions and offer
support for geometric measures of basic constructionist principles in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统任务导向对话系统需要大量标注数据，而本文旨在通过结合BERT和LLMs的优势，减少数据需求并提升性能。

Method: 采用混合方法，利用LLMs的泛化能力和BERT的计算效率，在零样本和少样本设置下进行意图识别和OOS检测。

Result: 在多轮对话语料库上评估，发现共享BERT输出信息给LLMs可提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 混合方法在减少数据需求的同时，有效提升了意图识别和OOS检测的性能。

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue
systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is
Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However,
traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we
propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot
settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages
LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such
scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and
observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system
performance improvement.

Conclusion: 提出的方法改进了模型对否定查询的处理能力，并提供了对现有数据集的分析工具。

Abstract: Understanding and solving complex reasoning tasks is vital for addressing the
information needs of a user. Although dense neural models learn contextualised
embeddings, they still underperform on queries containing negation. To
understand this phenomenon, we study negation in both traditional neural
information retrieval and LLM-based models. We (1) introduce a taxonomy of
negation that derives from philosophical, linguistic, and logical definitions;
(2) generate two benchmark datasets that can be used to evaluate the
performance of neural information retrieval models and to fine-tune models for
a more robust performance on negation; and (3) propose a logic-based
classification mechanism that can be used to analyze the performance of
retrieval models on existing datasets. Our taxonomy produces a balanced data
distribution over negation types, providing a better training setup that leads
to faster convergence on the NevIR dataset. Moreover, we propose a
classification schema that reveals the coverage of negation types in existing
datasets, offering insights into the factors that might affect the
generalization of fine-tuned models on negation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“Traits Run Deep”的人格评估框架，通过心理学提示和多模态融合技术显著提升了人格评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人格评估在情感智能、心理健康诊断等领域至关重要，但传统方法难以捕捉跨模态的异步信号。

Method: 使用心理学提示引导大语言模型提取人格语义，设计文本中心的多模态融合网络，包括降维、跨模态连接和文本特征增强模块。

Result: 在AVI验证集上MSE降低约45%，在AVI Challenge 2025测试集上排名第一。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和心理学提示显著提升了人格评估的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable personality assessment plays a vital role in many
fields, such as emotional intelligence, mental health diagnostics, and
personalized education. Unlike fleeting emotions, personality traits are
stable, often subconsciously leaked through language, facial expressions, and
body behaviors, with asynchronous patterns across modalities. It was hard to
model personality semantics with traditional superficial features and seemed
impossible to achieve effective cross-modal understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel personality assessment framework called
\textit{\textbf{Traits Run Deep}}. It employs
\textit{\textbf{psychology-informed prompts}} to elicit high-level
personality-relevant semantic representations. Besides, it devises a
\textit{\textbf{Text-Centric Trait Fusion Network}} that anchors rich text
semantics to align and integrate asynchronous signals from other modalities. To
be specific, such fusion module includes a Chunk-Wise Projector to decrease
dimensionality, a Cross-Modal Connector and a Text Feature Enhancer for
effective modality fusion and an ensemble regression head to improve
generalization in data-scarce situations. To our knowledge, we are the first to
apply personality-specific prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in
extracting personality-aware semantics for improved representation quality.
Furthermore, extracting and fusing audio-visual apparent behavior features
further improves the accuracy. Experimental results on the AVI validation set
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed components, i.e.,
approximately a 45\% reduction in mean squared error (MSE). Final evaluations
on the test set of the AVI Challenge 2025 confirm our method's superiority,
ranking first in the Personality Assessment track. The source code will be made
available at https://github.com/MSA-LMC/TraitsRunDeep.

Conclusion: PATENTWRITER为专利生成提供了统一评估标准，支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in
several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent
writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In
this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework
for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a
patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a
consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER
goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output
quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g.,
BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations,
and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks.
We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone.
Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and
stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific
baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and
future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIAH基准虽广泛用于评估LLMs的长上下文理解能力，但可能高估其真实能力，需更准确的评估方法。

Method: 提出新基准NeedleChain，完全由查询相关信息组成，并引入ROPE Contraction策略改进LLMs的长上下文理解。

Result: 实验显示先进LLMs（如GPT-4o）在处理长上下文时仍存在理解不足，NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction显著提升了评估和性能。

Conclusion: NeedleChain和ROPE Contraction为LLMs的长上下文理解提供了更全面评估和改进方法，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: The Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH) benchmark is widely used to evaluate Large
Language Models' (LLMs) ability to understand long contexts (LC). It evaluates
the capability to identify query-relevant context within extensive
query-irrelevant passages. Although this method serves as a widely accepted
standard for evaluating long-context understanding, our findings suggest it may
overestimate the true LC capability of LLMs. We demonstrate that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o struggle to intactly incorporate given
contexts made up of solely query-relevant ten sentences. In response, we
introduce a novel benchmark, \textbf{NeedleChain}, where the context consists
entirely of query-relevant information, requiring the LLM to fully grasp the
input to answer correctly. Our benchmark allows for flexible context length and
reasoning order, offering a more comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.
Additionally, we propose an extremely simple yet compelling strategy to improve
LC understanding capability of LLM: ROPE Contraction. Our experiments with
various advanced LLMs reveal a notable disparity between their ability to
process large contexts and their capacity to fully understand them. Source code

Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否能生成具有文化多样性的故事，揭示AI叙事中的潜在偏见。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-mini为236个国家各生成50个故事，分析其叙事结构和主题。

Result: 故事叙事结构单一，偏向小城镇、传统与和解，缺乏现实冲突和多样性。

Conclusion: AI生成的故事存在叙事标准化偏见，需在文化对齐和多样性改进中加以关注。

Abstract: Can a language model trained largely on Anglo-American texts generate stories
that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt "Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and
efforts to improve the cultural alignment of generative AI.

Result: Falcon-H1在性能上超越或匹配更大规模的模型（如Qwen3-32B、Llama3.3-70B），同时在推理、数学、多语言任务等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Falcon-H1通过混合架构和高效设计，为广泛的应用场景提供了高性能且开源的解决方案。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Falcon-H1, a new series of large language models
(LLMs) featuring hybrid architecture designs optimized for both high
performance and efficiency across diverse use cases. Unlike earlier Falcon
models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a
parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State
Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational
efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and
training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1
is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned
variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized
instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on
Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B
matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,
and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models
show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B
models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.
These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,
instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K
context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of
applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license,
underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.

*Tian Yun,Chen Sun,Ellie Pavlick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在零样本设置下表现不佳，但通过微调少量参数可实现接近完美的性能，但这种性能不一定能跨数据集迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否具备“抽象推理”能力，并重新定义其意义。

Method: 在零样本和微调设置下测试LLMs性能，并分析跨数据集迁移能力。

Result: 微调显著提升性能，但跨数据集迁移效果有限。

Conclusion: 需重新讨论“抽象推理”的定义及其对LLMs的意义。

Abstract: Recent work has argued that large language models (LLMs) are not "abstract
reasoners", citing their poor zero-shot performance on a variety of challenging
tasks as evidence. We revisit these experiments in order to add nuance to the
claim. First, we show that while LLMs indeed perform poorly in a zero-shot
setting, even tuning a small subset of parameters for input encoding can enable
near-perfect performance. However, we also show that this finetuning does not
necessarily transfer across datasets. We take this collection of empirical
results as an invitation to (re-)open the discussion of what it means to be an
"abstract reasoner", and why it matters whether LLMs fit the bill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中对代码生成的要求不仅限于正确性，还需满足编码风格、行数和结构约束等细节要求。

Method: 引入前向和后向约束生成方法，提升Code LLMs在可控代码生成中的指令遵循能力。

Result: 实验表明闭源模型在可控代码生成中优于开源模型，且模型生成正确代码与精确遵循指令之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法和基准为可控代码生成提供了更细致的评估标准，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) have made significant progress in code
generation by translating natural language descriptions into functional code;
however, real-world applications often demand stricter adherence to detailed
requirements such as coding style, line count, and structural constraints,
beyond mere correctness. To address this, the paper introduces forward and
backward constraints generation to improve the instruction-following
capabilities of Code LLMs in controlled code generation, ensuring outputs align
more closely with human-defined guidelines. The authors further present
IFEvalCode, a multilingual benchmark comprising 1.6K test samples across seven
programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, C++, and
C#), with each sample featuring both Chinese and English queries. Unlike
existing benchmarks, IFEvalCode decouples evaluation into two metrics:
correctness (Corr.) and instruction-following (Instr.), enabling a more nuanced
assessment. Experiments on over 40 LLMs reveal that closed-source models
outperform open-source ones in controllable code generation and highlight a
significant gap between the models' ability to generate correct code versus
code that precisely follows instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小语言模型（SLMs）在推理速度和边缘部署方面具有优势，但其在Text-to-SQL任务中表现不佳。研究旨在探索如何通过后训练技术提升SLMs的性能。

Method: 利用SynSQL-2.5M数据集构建了SynSQL-Think-916K和SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K两个衍生数据集，结合监督微调和基于强化学习的后训练，并采用自校正一致性推理方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，SLM-SQL方法显著提升了性能，0.5B和1.5B模型在BIRD开发集上的执行准确率分别达到56.87%和67.08%，平均提升31.4分。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过后训练技术可以有效提升SLMs在Text-to-SQL任务中的性能，为边缘部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). In
contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters
currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical
reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference
speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in
Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training
techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to
construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and
SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed
by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the
BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement
of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy
(EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX. We will release our dataset,
model, and code to github: https://github.com/CycloneBoy/slm_sql.

TL;DR: CliCARE框架通过将纵向癌症电子健康记录转化为时间知识图谱，并结合临床指南，显著提升了临床决策支持的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床决策支持中面临的三大挑战：处理长文本和多语言记录的能力不足、临床幻觉风险高、以及评估指标不可靠。

Method: 将非结构化的纵向电子健康记录转化为患者特定的时间知识图谱，并与规范性指南知识图谱对齐，生成临床摘要和可操作建议。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上显著优于基线模型，临床有效性得到专家评估的高相关性支持。

Conclusion: CliCARE为临床决策支持提供了高效、可靠的方法，有望减少医生负担并提升癌症诊疗质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical
decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex,
longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their
implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the
inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature
of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of
clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate
process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that
hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we
propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical
Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health
Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs
into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range
dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these
real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph.
This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by
generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation.
We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private
Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these
diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The
clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol,
which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert
oncologists.

Motivation: 由于缺乏反映真实客户交互的基准数据集，企业难以选择合适的ViLLMs用于支持应用，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 研究团队从一家越南软件公司的真实客户交互中提取了9000多个问答对，构建了CSConDa数据集，并提出了一个综合评估框架，对11个轻量级开源ViLLMs进行了自动指标和句法分析。

Result: 研究揭示了模型的优缺点和语言模式，为下一代ViLLMs的开发提供了改进方向。

Conclusion: 通过建立稳健的基准和系统评估，该研究支持了客户服务问答中的模型选择，并推动了越南语大语言模型的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become essential for Question Answering (QA) systems, improving
efficiency and reducing human workload in customer service. The emergence of
Vietnamese LLMs (ViLLMs) highlights lightweight open-source models as a
practical choice for their accuracy, efficiency, and privacy benefits. However,
domain-specific evaluations remain limited, and the absence of benchmark
datasets reflecting real customer interactions makes it difficult for
enterprises to select suitable models for support applications. To address this
gap, we introduce the Customer Support Conversations Dataset (CSConDa), a
curated benchmark of over 9,000 QA pairs drawn from real interactions with
human advisors at a large Vietnamese software company. Covering diverse topics
such as pricing, product availability, and technical troubleshooting, CSConDa
provides a representative basis for evaluating ViLLMs in practical scenarios.
We further present a comprehensive evaluation framework, benchmarking 11
lightweight open-source ViLLMs on CSConDa with both automatic metrics and
syntactic analysis to reveal model strengths, weaknesses, and linguistic
patterns. This study offers insights into model behavior, explains performance
differences, and identifies key areas for improvement, supporting the
development of next-generation ViLLMs. By establishing a robust benchmark and
systematic evaluation, our work enables informed model selection for customer
service QA and advances research on Vietnamese LLMs. The dataset is publicly

TL;DR: ControlMed是一种医疗语言模型，通过细粒度控制标记让用户主动控制推理过程的长度，解决了现有推理LLMs在临床环境中因冗长推理导致的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要高可靠性的支持，但现有推理LLMs因冗长的推理过程导致计算开销和响应延迟，限制了实际应用。

Method: ControlMed通过三阶段训练：1）预训练大规模合成医疗指令数据集；2）监督微调多长度推理数据和显式长度控制标记；3）强化学习提升准确性和质量。

Result: 实验显示ControlMed在英语和韩语医疗基准测试中表现优于或接近现有最佳模型，用户可灵活平衡推理准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: ControlMed是临床问答和医疗信息分析的实用且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced accuracy and
explainability are increasingly being adopted in the medical domain, as the
life-critical nature of clinical decision-making demands reliable support.
Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational
overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical
deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to
actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through
fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage
pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction
dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2)
supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit
length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward
signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results
on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our
model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art
models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and
computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These
findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for
clinical question answering and medical information analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出CognitiveAttack框架，通过多认知偏差组合攻击LLM安全机制，显著提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的安全机制易受认知偏差攻击，现有方法多关注单一偏差或工程手段，忽视了多偏差交互的潜在威胁。

Method: 结合监督微调和强化学习，生成嵌入优化偏差组合的提示，系统攻击LLM。

Result: 在30种LLM上测试，攻击成功率显著高于现有方法（60.1% vs. 31.6%），开源模型尤其脆弱。

Conclusion: 多偏差交互是未充分探索的攻击向量，研究为跨学科（认知科学与AI安全）提供了新视角，推动更鲁棒的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel
interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety,
paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言特定神经元在多语言模型中的作用，特别是放大这些神经元对模型行为的影响。

Method: 通过干预18种语言（包括低资源语言）的语言特定神经元，提出LSS评分评估放大效果，并在下游任务（如常识推理、知识、翻译）中验证。

Result: 最优放大因子能有效引导输出至目标语言，但对跨语言任务表现普遍下降。

Conclusion: 放大语言特定神经元对低资源语言有益，但对跨语言迁移帮助有限。

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual
languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them.
However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work
investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through
interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three
models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification
factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a
proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on
downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge
(Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors
effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using
this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some
cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight
the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where
amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but
provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语LLM性能落后，主要由于数据稀缺、语言多样性和形态复杂性，现有基准测试质量不足。

Method: 引入BALSAM基准，包含78个NLP任务、52K样本，并提供透明盲测平台。

Result: BALSAM为阿拉伯语LLM开发提供统一标准和协作研究平台。

Conclusion: BALSAM有望推动阿拉伯语LLM的发展，并促进研究合作。

Abstract: The impressive advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) in English has not
been matched across all languages. In particular, LLM performance in Arabic
lags behind, due to data scarcity, linguistic diversity of Arabic and its
dialects, morphological complexity, etc. Progress is further hindered by the
quality of Arabic benchmarks, which typically rely on static, publicly
available data, lack comprehensive task coverage, or do not provide dedicated
platforms with blind test sets. This makes it challenging to measure actual
progress and to mitigate data contamination. Here, we aim to bridge these gaps.
In particular, we introduce BALSAM, a comprehensive, community-driven benchmark
aimed at advancing Arabic LLM development and evaluation. It includes 78 NLP
tasks from 14 broad categories, with 52K examples divided into 37K test and 15K
development, and a centralized, transparent platform for blind evaluation. We
envision BALSAM as a unifying platform that sets standards and promotes
collaborative research to advance Arabic LLM capabilities.

Motivation: 探索多语言大模型中语言特异性处理的神经机制，以理解语言行为控制的内部表征。

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵（LAPE）方法分析神经元，并通过语言算术（激活加减乘除）操控模型行为。

Result: 发现语言特异性神经元集中在深层，非拉丁文字语言表现出更强的特异性；语言操控在多语言任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 神经元操控能有效控制语言行为，且语言相似性提升操控效果，揭示了语言选择的内部机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities, yet the
neural mechanisms behind language-specific processing remain unclear. We
analyze language-specific neurons in Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-Nemo-12B, and
Aya-Expanse-8B & 32B across 21 typologically diverse languages, identifying
neurons that control language behavior. Using the Language Activation
Probability Entropy (LAPE) method, we show that these neurons cluster in deeper
layers, with non-Latin scripts showing greater specialization. Related
languages share overlapping neurons, reflecting internal representations of
linguistic proximity.
  Through language arithmetics, i.e. systematic activation addition and
multiplication, we steer models to deactivate unwanted languages and activate
desired ones, outperforming simpler replacement approaches. These interventions
effectively guide behavior across five multilingual tasks: language forcing,
translation, QA, comprehension, and NLI. Manipulation is more successful for
high-resource languages, while typological similarity improves effectiveness.
We also demonstrate that cross-lingual neuron steering enhances downstream
performance and reveal internal "fallback" mechanisms for language selection
when neurons are progressively deactivated. Our code is made publicly available
at https://github.com/d-gurgurov/Language-Neurons-Manipulation.

Result: 更大模型普遍偏向自由左翼立场，语言和模型家族间存在显著差异，干预技术可有效操控政治立场。

Conclusion: LLMs的政治偏见具有普遍性和可控性，为未来研究和应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday tools and
applications, raising concerns about their potential influence on political
views. While prior research has shown that LLMs often exhibit measurable
political biases--frequently skewing toward liberal or progressive
positions--key gaps remain. Most existing studies evaluate only a narrow set of
models and languages, leaving open questions about the generalizability of
political biases across architectures, scales, and multilingual settings.
Moreover, few works examine whether these biases can be actively controlled.
  In this work, we address these gaps through a large-scale study of political
orientation in modern open-source instruction-tuned LLMs. We evaluate seven
models, including LLaMA-3.1, Qwen-3, and Aya-Expanse, across 14 languages using
the Political Compass Test with 11 semantically equivalent paraphrases per
statement to ensure robust measurement. Our results reveal that larger models
consistently shift toward libertarian-left positions, with significant
variations across languages and model families. To test the manipulability of
political stances, we utilize a simple center-of-mass activation intervention
technique and show that it reliably steers model responses toward alternative
ideological positions across multiple languages. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 该框架通过捕捉显性和隐性线索，实现了全面且无偏的面试评估，推动了自动化多模态评估的发展。

Abstract: Interview performance assessment is essential for determining candidates'
suitability for professional positions. To ensure holistic and fair
evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores
``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three}
modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and
\textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs
modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and
subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module
compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating
efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate
a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads
predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across
responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five
target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both
explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and
unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our
framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview
performance assessment. The full implementation is available at

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的微调方案，无需人工标注，为幻觉感知的模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reducing hallucinations in abstractive summarization remains a critical
challenge for deploying language models (LMs) in real-world settings. In this
work, we introduce a rewarddriven fine-tuning framework that explicitly
optimizes for Entity Hallucination Index (EHI), a metric designed to quantify
the presence, correctness, and grounding of named entities in generated
summaries. Given a corpus of meeting transcripts, we first generate baseline
summaries using a pre-trained LM and compute EHI scores via automatic entity
extraction and matching. We then apply reinforcement learning to fine-tune the
model parameters, using EHI as a reward signal to bias generation toward
entity-faithful outputs. Our approach does not rely on human-written factuality
annotations, enabling scalable fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements in EHI across datasets, with qualitative analysis revealing a
significant reduction in entity-level hallucinations without degradation in
fluency or informativeness. We release a reproducible Colab pipeline,
facilitating further research on hallucination-aware model fine-tuning using
lightweight, hallucintion metrics like EHI.

Conclusion: TIRESRAG-R1显著提升了RAG方法的推理能力和稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods
enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most
rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality.
This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main
failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to
retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level
flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning
inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final
answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a
think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve
reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to
encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the
rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to
detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting
strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks.
Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms
prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data
are available at: https://github.com/probe2/TIRESRAG-R1.

*Kwesi Cobbina,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型（LLM）的上下文学习（ICL）性能受演示（demos）位置影响，提出DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP)偏差，并通过实验验证其影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL中未被研究的位置偏差（DPP），揭示其对模型预测和准确性的影响。

Method: 设计系统性评估流程，引入ACCURACY-CHANGE和PREDICTION-CHANGE指标，在分类、问答、摘要和推理任务中测试十种LLM。

Result: 演示位置显著影响模型性能，开头位置最稳定准确（提升+6分），末尾位置导致30%预测反转但未提升准确性。小模型受影响最大。

Conclusion: DPP偏差普遍存在，需在ICL设计中考虑演示位置以优化性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a critical emerging capability of large language
models (LLMs), enabling few-shot learning during inference by including a few
demonstrations (demos) in the prompt. However, it has been found that ICL's
performance can be sensitive to the choices of demos and their order. This
paper investigates an unexplored new positional bias of ICL for the first time:
we observe that the predictions and accuracy can drift drastically when the
positions of demos, the system prompt, and the user message in LLM input are
varied. We refer to this bias as DEMOS' POSITION IN PROMPT (DPP) bias. We
design a systematic evaluation pipeline to study this type of positional bias
across classification, question answering, summarization, and reasoning tasks.
We introduce two metrics, ACCURACY-CHANGE and PREDICTION-CHANGE, to quantify
net gains and output volatility induced by changes in the demos' position.
Extensive experiments on ten LLMs from four open-source model families (QWEN,
LLAMA3, MISTRAL, COHERE) verify that the bias significantly affects their
accuracy and predictions: placing demos at the start of the prompt yields the
most stable and accurate outputs with gains of up to +6 points. In contrast,
placing demos at the end of the user message flips over 30\% of predictions
without improving correctness on QA tasks. Smaller models are most affected by
this sensitivity, though even large models remain marginally affected on
complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs生成事实错误（幻觉）的问题，提升其可靠性和有效性，尤其在多语言环境中。

Method: 分析GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.1等模型在印地语、波斯语和汉语对话数据中的幻觉现象。

Result: 汉语中幻觉较少，印地语和波斯语中幻觉显著较多。

Conclusion: 多语言环境下LLMs的幻觉问题存在显著差异，需针对性优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating text that closely resemble human writing. However, they often
generate factually incorrect statements, a problem typically referred to as
'hallucination'. Addressing hallucination is crucial for enhancing the
reliability and effectiveness of LLMs. While much research has focused on
hallucinations in English, our study extends this investigation to
conversational data in three languages: Hindi, Farsi, and Mandarin. We offer a
comprehensive analysis of a dataset to examine both factual and linguistic
errors in these languages for GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama-3.1, Gemma-2.0,
DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3. We found that LLMs produce very few hallucinated
responses in Mandarin but generate a significantly higher number of
hallucinations in Hindi and Farsi.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过聚合技术、提示工程和对比微调，将预训练的解码器LLMs有效适配为文本嵌入模型，并在MTEB基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在文本生成中表现出色，但其词级表征在聚合为文本嵌入时会丢失关键信息，而许多非生成任务需要准确的句子或文档级嵌入。

Method: 采用三种策略：(i) 词嵌入聚合技术，(ii) 任务特定提示工程，(iii) 对比微调的文本级增强。

Result: 在MTEB的英文聚类任务中达到最优性能，注意力图分析显示微调后更关注语义相关词。

Conclusion: LLMs可通过提示工程和资源高效的对比微调有效适配为文本嵌入模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), achieving impressive performance in text generation. Their
token-level representations capture rich, human-aligned semantics. However,
pooling these vectors into a text embedding discards crucial information.
Nevertheless, many non-generative downstream tasks, such as clustering,
classification, or retrieval, still depend on accurate and controllable
sentence- or document-level embeddings. We explore several adaptation
strategies for pre-trained, decoder-only LLMs: (i) various aggregation
techniques for token embeddings, (ii) task-specific prompt engineering, and
(iii) text-level augmentation via contrastive fine-tuning. Combining these
components yields state-of-the-art performance on the English clustering track
of the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). An analysis of the attention
map further shows that fine-tuning shifts focus from prompt tokens to
semantically relevant words, indicating more effective compression of meaning
into the final hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can be
effectively adapted as text embedding models through a combination of prompt
engineering and resource-efficient contrastive fine-tuning on synthetically
generated positive pairs.

Abstract: We introduce a benchmark for open-ended regional question answering that
encompasses both textual and visual modalities. We also provide strong
baselines using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our dataset
consists of manually curated questions and answers grounded in Wikipedia,
created by native speakers from Czechia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, with
accompanying English translations. It includes both purely textual questions
and those requiring visual understanding. As a baseline, we evaluate
state-of-the-art LLMs through prompting and complement this with human
judgments of answer correctness. Using these human evaluations, we analyze the
reliability of existing automatic evaluation metrics. Our baseline results
highlight a significant gap in regional knowledge among current LLMs. Moreover,
apart from LLM-based evaluation, there is minimal correlation between automated
metrics and human judgment. We release this dataset as a resource to (1) assess
regional knowledge in LLMs, (2) study cross-lingual generation consistency in a
challenging setting, and (3) advance the development of evaluation metrics for
open-ended question answering.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and
agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling.
However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally
dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we
introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit
evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework
employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents
collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive
learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further
present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent
systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions.
Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment,
addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA
outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical
LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit
scoring.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化表示方法TaSoF和框架SPaGe，用于解决查询聚焦表摘要中自然语言计划的模糊性和缺乏结构性问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言计划在查询聚焦表摘要中存在模糊性和缺乏结构性的问题，限制了其转换为可执行程序（如SQL）的能力，尤其是在多表任务中。

Method: 提出结构化计划TaSoF和框架SPaGe，分为三个阶段：结构化规划生成TaSoF、基于图的执行转换为SQL并建模依赖关系、摘要生成。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中，SPaGe在单表和多表任务中均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 结构化表示方法显著提升了查询聚焦表摘要的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires complex reasoning, often
approached through step-by-step natural language (NL) plans. However, NL plans
are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into
executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for
multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured
representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by
formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that
formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to
generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps
into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel
execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our
method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability.
Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms
prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the
advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.
