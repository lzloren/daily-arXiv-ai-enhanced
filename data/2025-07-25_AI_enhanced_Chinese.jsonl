Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles.

For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner.

LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving\nthe creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.\nAdversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit\ndetectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have\nmainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying\naccuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature\nabout DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we\ninvestigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text\nClassifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can\nconsistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed\nto the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a\ndetector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)\nfor classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored\nquestion-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses\nusing DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied\nadversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more\nsamples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy\nimpact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on\noriginal and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text\nClassifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results.

In this work, we\nintroduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data\npipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,\ntask-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured\ndata, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing\nrecommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs\nthe selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs\nusing tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these\nhigh-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the\nneed for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient\npathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684Agentic AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee3\u7406\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8001\u5e74\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u59d1\u606f\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u7ed3\u80a0\u955c\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684AI\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GrAInS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4ee4\u724c\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e72\u9884\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "GrAInS\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u3002", "result": "GrAInS\u5728TruthfulQA\u3001MMHal-Bench\u548cSPA-VL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GrAInS\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and\nintroducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based\non sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model\nfamilies, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that\nthese tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,\nas well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their\npresence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size.

However, this process may increase the model's dependence on\nuser input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation\nand the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that\nLLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric\nknowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of\ninstruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact\nof instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis\nreveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept\nmisinformation when it is presented by the user.

The defining\ncharacteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ncapabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\". We advance this concept\nby proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks\nto one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's\nreasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning\nmethodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals\nthe desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These\nresponses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject\na controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning\nprocess.

Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely\navailable, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability\nof public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we\npresent AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\nreasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular\ndata. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question\nanswering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of\nArabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where\ninitial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by\nhuman experts to ensure high dataset quality.

With the rapid development of\nGenerative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)\nhave become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis.

This paper aims to\nconduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by\nformulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)\nthe purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation\nmethods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text.

When\ncoupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a \"good\"\nprompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us\nto train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for\nthe problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GSMHard\u548cMATH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002TRPrompt\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "TRPrompt\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u5bf9\u201c\u597d\u201d\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSMHard\u548cMATH\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTRPrompt\u751f\u6210\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TRPrompt\u6210\u529f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
