We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI\ninteracts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists\nand designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological\nrestoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue\nthat AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and\npractice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for\nAI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple\nreinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings\nhighlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and\nenvironmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on\nsustainable, technology-enabled ecosystems."}

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the\npotential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges\ndue to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of\ntraining data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing\nLLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such\nas linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both\napproaches and the importance of combining them."}

In particular, honeybees mainly\nuse the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their\nvisual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a\nReinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only\noptic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained\nagents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base\ntheir motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most\nattention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with\nlarge optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered\ntunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while\nmaintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the\nbehavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently\ntrained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for\ndeveloping a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs."}
